AB  - This article presents the preliminary effects of a didactic intervention based on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for teaching Newtonian mechanics concepts to first-year students in the Bachelor of Physics Education program at the University of Guayaquil. This intervention corresponds to the first phase of a quasi-experimental study conducted during the May–August 2024 semester, involving two parallel groups: a control group using traditional peer instruction strategies, and an experimental group using AI-guided activities through a web-based platform supported by ChatGPT. Both groups underwent a diagnostic pre-test, which revealed similar levels of initial conceptual knowledge. Following a structured and differentiated teaching process, a post-test was applied to assess the intervention's impact. The results showed a significant improvement in the conceptual understanding of the experimental group compared to the control group. The findings suggest that integrating AI tools in the classroom can positively impact physics learning by helping students overcome alternative conceptions and fostering a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of classical mechanics. The study highlights the feasibility of using virtual assistants as a complementary resource in science higher education environments.

AB  - Generative AI has the potential to transform personalization and accessibility of education. However, it raises serious concerns about accuracy and helping students become independent critical thinkers. In this study, we designed a helpful AI"Peer"to help students correct fundamental physics misconceptions related to Newtonian mechanic concepts. In contrast to approaches that seek near-perfect accuracy to create an authoritative AI tutor or teacher, we directly inform students that this AI can answer up to 40% of questions incorrectly. In a randomized controlled trial with 165 students, those who engaged in targeted dialogue with the AI Peer achieved post-test scores that were, on average, 10.5 percentage points higher - with over 20 percentage points higher normalized gain - than a control group that discussed physics history. Qualitative feedback indicated that 91% of the treatment group's AI interactions were rated as helpful. Furthermore, by comparing student performance on pre- and post-test questions about the same concept, along with experts' annotations of the AI interactions, we find initial evidence suggesting the improvement in performance does not depend on the correctness of the AI. With further research, the AI Peer paradigm described here could open new possibilities for how we learn, adapt to, and grow with AI.

 Grading assessments is time-consuming and prone to human bias. Students may experience delays in receiving feedback that may not be tailored to their expectations or needs. Harnessing AI in education can be effective for grading undergraduate physics problems, enhancing the efficiency of undergraduate-level physics learning and teaching, and helping students understand concepts with the help of a constantly available tutor. This report devises a simple empirical procedure to investigate and quantify how well large language model (LLM) based AI chatbots can grade solutions to undergraduate physics problems in Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetic Theory and Quantum Mechanics, comparing humans against AI grading. The following LLMs were tested: Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The results show AI grading is prone to mathematical errors and hallucinations, which render it less effective than human grading, but when given a mark scheme, there is substantial improvement in grading quality, which becomes closer to the level of human performance—promising for future AI implementation. Evidence indicates that the grading ability of LLM is correlated with its problem-solving ability. Through unsupervised clustering, it is shown that Classical Mechanics problems may be graded differently from other topics. The method developed can be applied to investigate AI grading performance in other STEM fields.

AB  - The latest development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly ChatGPT, has drawn the attention of educational researchers and practitioners. We have witnessed many innovative uses of ChatGPT in STEM classrooms. However, studies regarding students’ perceptions of ChatGPT as a virtual tutoring tool in STEM education are rare. The current study investigated undergraduate students’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in a physics class as an assistant tool for addressing physics questions. Specifically, the study examined the accuracy of ChatGPT in answering physics questions, the relationship between students’ ChatGPT trust levels and answer accuracy, and the influence of trust on students’ perceptions of ChatGPT. Our finding indicates that despite the inaccuracy of GenAI in question answering, most students trust its ability to provide correct answers. Trust in GenAI is also associated with students’ perceptions of GenAI. In addition, this study sheds light on students’ misconceptions toward GenAI and provides suggestions for future considerations in AI literacy teaching and research.

AB  - This Work in Progress paper introduces the design of an innovative educational system that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to address challenges in physics education. The primary objective is to create a system that dynamically adapts to the individual needs and preferences of students while maintaining user-friendliness for teachers, allowing them to tailor their teaching methods. The emphasis is on fostering motivation and engagement, achieved through the implementation of a gamified virtual environment and a strong focus on personalization. Our aim is to develop a system capable of autonomously generating learning activities and constructing effective learning paths, all under the supervision and interaction of teachers. The generation of learning activities is guided by educational taxonomies that delineate and categorize the cognitive processes involved in these activities. The proposed educational system seeks to address challenges identified by Physics Education Research (PER), which offers valuable insights into how individuals learn physics and provides strategies to enhance the overall quality of physics education. Our specific focus revolves around two crucial aspects: concentrating on the conceptual understanding of physics concepts and processes, and fostering knowledge integration and coherence across various physics topics. These aspects are deemed essential for cultivating enduring knowledge and facilitating practical applications in the field of physics.

AB  - The advent of artificial intelligence in educational institutions has been met with fear and concern due to the ethical implications it carries, especially in the assessment of learning. In this work, results from an experiment aimed at using artificial intelligence as an ally in teaching numerical calculus will be presented. The teaching experience was implemented in an intensive course (five weeks for a total of 24 hours) on numerical methods for the solution of differential equations. The course was directed to undergraduate students of engineering programs in physics and data science. Not all the students attending the course had skills in the required programming language (Python) and, due to the short time, it was not possible to teach them basic computing during the course. The use of tools as chatGPT and Bing for code generation allowed the students to learn and apply different numerical methods of increasing complexity, and, at the same time, improve their skills in python programming. Numerical results of diagnostic exams and a sentiment analysis on the students’ perception about the use of artificial intelligence in the course will be presented.

AB  - The scope of an argumentative evaluation allows for evaluating comprehension, conceptual understanding, and similarity with the answer of an expert in the field, in this case, STEAM. Teachers have assessment resources, with some risk of bias. An automated assessment tool, based on AI can objectively identify relevant didactic aspects, previously established. This paper investigates how the argued responses of 244 engineering students to an acceleration problem are formed, analyzed from 1) their similarity with the response of an expert by the AI tool and 2) their level of understanding (I-IV), in the light of SOLO taxonomy, by a group of expert teachers in the teaching of Physics. The findings of this work show that: 1) the tool calculated that the average percentage of response similarity with an expert is 44%, 2) the group of teachers reported that the prestructural (I) and relational (IV) levels of understanding obtained the highest percentage in the evaluation of the average and instantaneous acceleration, followed by the prestructural and unistructural levels in the characterization of the acceleration. The integration of results broadens the perspective of evaluation and analysis of the conceptual understanding achieved by the students since it quantifies how much their answers are aligned with that of an expert. Moreover, the levels of understanding of the concept of acceleration are displayed. In this way, the use and combination of this AI tool contribute to a better understanding gaps and conceptual difficulties in first-year engineering students.

AB  - Generative AI tools, including the popular ChatGPT, have made a clear mark on discourses related to future work and education practices. Previous research in science education has highlighted the potential for generative AI in various education-related areas, including generating valuable discussion material, solving physics problems, and acting as a tutor. However, little research has been done regarding the role of generative AI tools in laboratory work, an essential part of science education, and physics education specifically. Here we show various ways in which high school students use ChatGPT during a physics laboratory session and discuss the relevance of using generative AI tools to investigate acoustic levitation and the speed of sound in air. The findings show agreement with previous research regarding the importance of educating students about the capabilities and limitations of using generative AI. Contrasting fruitful and problematic interactions with ChatGPT during lab sessions with seven lab groups involving 19 high school students made it possible to identify that ChatGPT can be a helpful tool in the physics laboratory. However, the teacher plays a crucial role in identifying students' needs and capabilities of understanding the potential and limitations of generative AI. As such, our findings show that generative AI tools may handle some questions and problems and thus demonstrate their potential to help distribute teachers' workload more equitably during laboratory sessions. Finally, this study serves as an important point of discussion regarding the ways in which students need support and training to efficiently utilize generative AI to further their learning of physics.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in text-based tasks but struggle with the complex reasoning required for physics problems, particularly in advanced arithmetic and conceptual understanding. While some research has explored ways to enhance LLMs in physics education using techniques such as prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG), not enough effort has been made in addressing their limitations in physics reasoning. This paper presents a novel approach to improving LLM performance on physics questions using Reinforcement Learning with Human and Artificial Intelligence Feedback (RLHAIF). We evaluate several reinforcement learning methods, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Remax optimization. These methods are chosen to investigate RL policy performance with different settings on the PhyQA dataset, which includes challenging physics problems from high school textbooks. Our RLHAIF model, tested on leading LLMs like LLaMA2 and Mistral, achieved superior results, notably with the MISTRAL-PPO model, demonstrating marked improvements in reasoning and accuracy. It achieved high scores, with a 58.67 METEOR score and a 0.74 Reasoning score, making it a strong example for future physics reasoning research in this area.

AB  - Introductory physics courses often necessitate students to graphically represent one-dimensional (1-D) motion and derive various physical parameters. Physical quantities are often solved by calculating either slope or the area under the graph. Instructors and students who do not have access to paid software must plot graphs by hand. This paper explores three introductory physics examples related to 1-D motion, and employs ChatGPT 3.5 to generate scripts that will produce graphs from raw data. It can generate scripts, based on accurate user inputs, in free programming languages like Python and/or GNU Octave to enable efficient graph plotting. Examples will be provided on calculating the slope of a distance–time graph and determining the area under a velocity–time graph. Given raw data, ChatGPT 3.5 may exhibit occasional inaccuracies when solving for physical parameters. However, user can communicate in English to modify the output. The author does not endorse the use of ChatGPT for academic misconducts such as assisting students to cheat in problem solving. Instead, ChatGPT is presented as a tool to enhance data visualisation for both instructors and students, which can potentially improve learning environments in introductory physics. This paper lays the groundwork for future initiatives, beyond the plotting of 1-D motion graphs, aiming to integrate artificial intelligence to assist more complex motion studies in physics learning environments.

AB  - The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based applications has become increasingly widespread in the context of digital learning following the COVID-19 pandemic, where this technology has facilitated the teaching and learning (T&L) process virtually. Although various digital applications have been introduced in T&L methods, understanding the trends in AI-based application usage and its effectiveness in mastering Quantum Physics topics remains underexplored. Quantum Physics topics involve abstract concepts and often result in many misconceptions in students' understanding, leading to difficulties in mastering these topics. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify how the integration of AI-based applications in digital learning and T&L methods can empower T&L approaches in Quantum Physics. A systematic literature review was conducted on sources published from 2018 to 2024, covering 26 relevant journal articles and books. The findings indicate that the trend of using AI-based applications in Quantum Physics T&L methods is increasing globally, along with evidence of its effectiveness in enhancing students' interest, engagement, and understanding of abstract concepts through more dynamic and interactive approaches. T&L methods that involve interaction with learning content, such as the PopAi platform, can increase students' interest and engagement by simplifying the teaching of highly complex quantum physics concepts. Therefore, digital learning readiness also needs to be enhanced, including digital infrastructure and operational skills, so that the full potential of this AI technology can be harnessed in line with the success of the education revolution 4.0. Additionally, it can prepare future generations to be skilled in digital technology, ready to face challenges and opportunities in the era of technological advancement. In conclusion, the use of AI technology in Quantum Physics T&L methods is increasing, along with evidence of its effectiveness in improving students' achievement and interest in Quantum Physics T&L.

To address this issue, we provide scientific and didactic support to teachers through different kinds of training sessions to introduce innovative didactic methodologies for teaching and learning. The project involved a training course both in streaming and carried-out sessions with university staff as well as secondary school teachers. We selected current research such as climate change, space missions, and Einstein’s relativity since they are not commonly included in the Italian physics curriculum; we suggested an approach based on some new methodologies and technologies to introduce these topics. We used microcontroller development boards for measuring environmental parameters, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and data processing applied to Open Data from space missions or weather archives. We also suggested a new approach to teaching modern physics. For this purpose, we used a web-based platform to explore the basic concepts of relativistic physics by emphasizing its impact on Global Positioning Systems, which is of utmost importance in everyday life.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) to enhance the quality of physics education in
Vietnamese high schools, aligning with the competency-
based approach of the General Education Program 2018. The
research employed a mixed-methods approach, surveying 82
physics teachers to assess their awareness, attitudes, and
current application of AI in teaching. The findings reveal that
while teachers recognize the potential benefits of AI, such as
personalized learning and workload reduction, significant
challenges remain, including limited AI knowledge, lack of
infrastructure, and appropriate AI tools. The study suggests
targeted training programs for teachers, focusing on popular
AI applications like ChatGPT and Gemini and promoting
active teaching models integrated with AI. It recommends
further research to evaluate the practical effectiveness of AI
in physics teaching and its impact on student learning
outcomes. The study concludes that AI can significantly
transform physics education by empowering teachers and
creating engaging student learning experiences.

AB  - This study aimed at evaluating how students perceive the linguistic quality and scientific accuracy of ChatGPT responses to physics comprehension questions. A total of 102 first- and second-year physics students were confronted with three questions of progressing difficulty from introductory mechanics (rolling motion, waves, and fluid dynamics). Each question was presented with four different responses. All responses were attributed to ChatGPT, but in reality one sample solution was created by the researchers. All ChatGPT responses obtained in this study were wrong, imprecise, incomplete, or misleading. We found little differences in the perceived linguistic quality between ChatGPT responses and the sample solution. However, the students rated the overall scientific accuracy of the responses significantly differently, with the sample solution being rated best for the questions of low and medium difficulty. The discrepancy between the sample solution and the ChatGPT responses increased with the level of self-assessed knowledge of the question content. For the question of highest difficulty (fluid dynamics) that was unknown to most students, a ChatGPT response was rated just as good as the sample solution. Thus, this study provides data on the students' perception of ChatGPT responses and the factors influencing their perception. The results highlight the need for careful evaluation of ChatGPT responses both by instructors and students, particularly regarding scientific accuracy. Therefore, future research could explore the potential of similar "spot the bot"-activities in physics education to foster students' critical thinking skills.

AB  - [This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Qualitative Methods in PER: A Critical Examination.] Qualitative research methods have provided key insights in physics education research (PER) by drawing on non-numerical data such as text or video data. While different methods towards qualitative research exist, they share two essential steps: recognizing patterns in the data and interpreting these patterns. Although these methods have led to the development of rigorous theory, there are challenges: As such methods require a series of judgments by the analyst, they are difficult to validate and reproduce. Further, they are hard to scale so that they are unavailable to the analysis of large-scale data. In this way, important phenomena may remain inaccessible to qualitative analysis. Reacting to these challenges and leveraging the potential of emerging methods of artificial intelligence (AI) such as machine learning and natural language processing, sociologist Nelson has proposed the concept of computational grounded theory (CGT). CGT proceeds in a process of three consecutive steps: In the first step, one leverages the power of computational techniques, especially natural language processing and unsupervised machine learning techniques, for pattern detection in large datasets—those of a size and scope that may prohibit human-driven analysis from the outset. In the second step, one relies on the integrative and interpretative capabilities of human researchers to add quality and depth to the quantity and breadth of the first step. In the last step, one again uses computational techniques to test the extent to which the detected and refined patterns from the first and second step hold throughout the whole dataset under investigation. Interestingly, CGT does not aim at simply automating parts of the qualitative process by using AI, but rather aims at integrating AI into the human analyst’s workflow within a qualitative analysis. This leads to an analytical system that can do something that is quantitatively and qualitatively different from what a human or machine can do alone. In this way, CGT aims at addressing questions about validity, reproducibility, and scalability in qualitative research while preserving the theoretical sensitivity and unique inferencing capabilities of the human analyst. In this paper, we provide a primer on CGT, present how it can be used to investigate the physics problem-solving approaches of N=417 students based on textual data, and discuss CGT’s potentials and challenges in PER. In consequence, this paper can provide critical input to the discussion of how emerging AI technologies can provide new avenues in qualitative PER.4 MoreReceived 30 January 2023Accepted 11 August 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.19.020123Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

AB  - Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be easily integrated into virtual education to drive adaptive instruction and real-time constructive feedback to students, offering a possible conduit for fostering discovery curiosity in learners. This study examines and characterizes Human-AI-Teaming (HAT) coordination dynamics to monitor the inception of discovery curiosity in online laboratories of interactive molecular dynamics (IMD). We used molecular physics measures (kinetic/ potential energy and action) obtained from simple and complex examples of simulated mouse tracking datasets in IMD log files as a proxy for understanding the context of molecular sciences and developing novel interactions for inquiry. These measures are good features of our HAT context because kinetic energy reflects the system’s atoms’ overall motion regarding the individual atoms’ speed. While kinetic energy represents if a learner applies artificial forces to the task, potential energy can be AI’s response to these forces. The action is a systems-level reaction to the changes during the task. By applying nonlinear dynamical systems methods to the physics measures, we extracted the Largest Lyapunov Exponent and Determinism metrics as HATs’ coordination stability and predictability, respectively. The findings underline that while the more complex IMD task required less stable and predictable HAT coordination dynamics, the simple task is more. One explanation is that AI needs to anticipate the learner by providing feedback at the right time and place during the more complex IMD task to initiate and sustain the learner’s discovery curiosity. In IMD, future HAT design should consider coordination dynamics for fostering ‘discovery curiosity’ and practical learning.

AB  - Physics education research (PER) shares a rich tradition of designing learning environments that promote valued epistemic practices such as sensemaking and mechanistic reasoning. Recent technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence has caught significant traction in the PER community due to its human-like, sophisticated responses to physics tasks. In this study, we contribute to the ongoing efforts by comparing AI (ChatGPT) and student responses to a physics task through the cognitive frameworks of sensemaking and mechanistic reasoning. Findings highlight that by virtue of its training data set, ChatGPT’s response provide evidence of mechanistic reasoning and mimics the vocabulary of experts in its responses. On the other hand, half of students’ responses evidenced sensemaking and reflected an effective amalgamation of diagram-based and mathematical reasoning, showcasing a comprehensive problem-solving approach. Thus, while AI responses elegantly reflected how physics is talked about, a part of students’ responses reflected how physics is practiced. In a second part of the study, we presented ChatGPT with variations of the task, including an open-ended version and one with significant scaffolding. We observed significant differences in conclusions and use of representations in solving the problems across both student groups and the task formats.

AB  - ChatGPT is a groundbreaking ``chatbot"--an AI interface built on a large language model that was trained on an enormous corpus of human text to emulate human conversation. Beyond its ability to converse in a plausible way, it has attracted attention for its ability to competently answer questions from the bar exam and from MBA coursework, and to provide useful assistance in writing computer code. These apparent abilities have prompted discussion of ChatGPT as both a threat to the integrity of higher education and conversely as a powerful teaching tool. In this work we present a preliminary analysis of how two versions of ChatGPT (ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4) fare in the field of first-semester university physics, using a modified version of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) to assess whether it can give correct responses to conceptual physics questions about kinematics and Newtonian dynamics. We demonstrate that, by some measures, ChatGPT3.5 can match or exceed the median performance of a university student who has completed one semester of college physics, though its performance is notably uneven and the results are nuanced. By these same measures, we find that ChatGPT4's performance is approaching the point of being indistinguishable from that of an expert physicist when it comes to introductory mechanics topics. After the completion of our work we became aware of Ref [1], which preceded us to publication and which completes an extensive analysis of the abilities of ChatGPT3.5 in a physics class, including a different modified version of the FCI. We view this work as confirming that portion of their results, and extending the analysis to ChatGPT4, which shows rapid and notable improvement in most, but not all respects.

The hypothesis of the study was the assumption of the leading role of self-education of schoolchildren in the field of studying intellectual technologies at the present stage. Analyzing the answers of the finalists, we determined that basic knowledge in four subjects of the general education cycle (mathematics, computer science, physics, and English) forms the basis for self-education in the process of preparation for the Olympiad. When solving new tasks for oneself, along with the assimilation of concepts and generalized methods of action, the student changes, transforming into a subject of educational activity. We have formed a rating of factors that helped the finalists in preparing for the finals of the Olympiad. The finalist’s awareness of their educational preferences allows them to build cognitive strategy, which is understood as the fulfillment of a specific set of tasks and a sequence of aimed at achieving an educational goal. The success of the self-educational trajectory is ensured by the observance of three principles of its implementation: obtaining high-quality subject knowledge, transforming the Olympiad finalist into a subject of educational activity, and building an individual strategy of self-determination.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to fundamentally change the educational landscape. So far, much of the physics education research relating to AI has focused on lecture-based assessment and the ability of ChatGPT to answer conceptual surveys and traditional exam-style questions. In this study, we shift the focus by investigating ChatGPT's ability to complete an introductory mechanics laboratory activity by using Code Interpreter, a recent plugin that allows users to generate and analyse data by writing and running Python code `behind the scenes'. By uploading a common `spring constant' lab activity using Code Interpreter, we investigate the ability of ChatGPT to interpret the activity, generate realistic model data, produce a line-fit, and calculate the reduced chi square statistic. By analysing our interactions with ChatGPT, along with the Python code generated by Code Interpreter, we assess how the quality and accuracy of ChatGPT's responses depends on different levels of prompt detail. We find that although ChatGPT is capable of completing the lab activity and generating plausible-looking data, the quality of the output is highly dependent on the detail and specificity of the text prompts provided. We find that the data generation process adopted by ChatGPT in this study leads to heteroscedasticity in the simulated data, which may be difficult for novice learners to spot. We also find that when real experimental data is uploaded via Code Interpreter, ChatGPT is capable of correctly plotting and fitting the data, calculating the spring constant and associated uncertainty, and calculating the reduced chi square statistic. This work offers new insights into the capabilities of Code Interpreter within a laboratory setting and highlights a variety of text-prompt strategies for the effective use of Code Interpreter in a lab context.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is an emerging technology that creates relevant text, images and other content from prompts. Large Language models (LLMs) are the most widely used of these GenAI forms. This technology already has applications in business and education.   
This paper tests GenAI’s ability to apply physics to global problems and arrive at viable solutions. When an idea is created by a human, it is merely a culmination of that person’s experiences and prior knowledge, ordered into a new concept. This research proposes that the process should be able to be replicated by a machine learning algorithm and, due to its vast database, a far more informed and coherent idea should be the result.  This research tested how well AI could tackle some global challenges and compared the results to how well these same challenges could be addressed by physicists.   
The data collection process was to have a dynamic conversation with each of the participants and work with them to create a number of ideas and solutions that apply physics to a selection of global issues. This process was repeated with both Bing AI and ChatGPT-4, where they were prompted to return ideas to the same issues. Each of the ideas were then coded to a marking scheme adapted from the ‘OECD DAC criteria for development evaluation’.   
While Bing AI did not prove itself to be capable of unique idea creation, ChatGPT-4 returned valuable data. ChatGPT-4 excelled at providing efficient, coherent and sustainable results whilst it performed significantly worse than humans in versatility and profitability.  
The findings show that at the present time, AI cannot work as an idea generation tool on its own due to lacking in accuracy and versatility. It is best applied in tandem with humans where it can be used to generate a series of ideas to a problem and physicists refine the results.

Integrating artificial intelligence into learning ecosystems is one of the biggest challenges for higher education. In this work, an intelligent tutoring system based on AI has been designed but with control of the possible responses. For this, a first diagnostic phase was carried out that determined the selection of initial material that will be used by the neural network or classifier algorithm, so that the teacher has control of the answers offered, limiting the sources of information used. Subsequently, this selection of documents is part of the input, together with the question in a large language model (LLM) ChatGPT-type conversational network.

AB  - According to the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MOSTI), the trend of students taking Additional Mathematics and Pure Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, is declining, with candidates taking the Malaysian Certificate of Education (SPM) in 2023 recording a decrease of 3.33% for Additional Mathematics, Physics (1.42%), Chemistry (1.42%), and Biology (2.2%). However, the results of SPM 2023 for all these subjects have increased compared to the previous year. Previous studies have shown that the use of digital technology like e-modul is seen as very helpful in improving student performance during Teaching and Learning sessions (TnL). Furthermore, the use of various technologies during TnL sessions has grown since the spread of COVID-19 making TnL sessions more flexible, easy to access and attracts students' interest in Science when they can interact directly with materials from global sources. This development has created a variety of digital teaching mediums and applications such as the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is capable of performing tasks and functions similar to human thinking to create a systematic TnL sessions. For example, the use of ChatGPT helps teachers efficiently prepare Daily Lesson Plans (DLP). The increased use of AI has also attracted the interest of major company like Google, which invested RM9.4 billion in Malaysia as an effort to enhance AI literacy programs for the benefit of teachers and students. Hence, this study is being conducted to identify the usage and impact of AI-based e-modules for Science subjects. Next, by conducting a systematic review analysis of 30 journal articles and books related to the use of AI in TnL sessions published between 2017 and 2024, an overview of the development of AI-based digital education in TnL sessions can be seen. The results of past studies found a positive increase where the use of AI in TnL sessions enhances understanding, motivation, student engagement and stimulates critical thinking among students. In conclusion, the findings from the literature review show that the application of AI in TnL helps students improve their achievement in Science. This is because the use of AI can personalize learning, provide automatic guidance and create interactive educational content, which directly increases students' interest and understanding. In line with the nation's commitment to enhancing dynamic STEM education, the realization of cultivating a highly knowledgeable and critical-thinking generation to confront the digital economy era will be achieved.

AB  - This study investigates how students utilized artificial intelligence (AI)-generated images to represent their understanding of general relativity concepts. Ten high school students participated in an extracurricular course on relativity theory. Using AI chatbot, these students created visual representations of ‘relativity’ before and after the course. The produced images, the accompanying prompts, student interviews, and their test scores were analysed to examine students’ conceptual understanding and interactions with AI. Students with a clearer understanding of relativity tended to focus their prompts on more central concepts like spacetime deformation. In contrast, those with a weaker understanding leaned towards more tangential ideas. The clarity of their prompts was directly linked to more effective AI interactions, leading to more meaningful image generation. Despite this, some students faced challenges in crafting coherent prompts, resulting in less relevant images, indicating that understanding the concept does not always translate into successful AI engagement. The study underscores the potential of AI-generated images as a tool to illuminate student conceptualisation and interaction skills with AI in the context of complex physics concepts, offering a novel approach to evaluating understanding in advanced scientific topics.

AB  - Artificial intelligence-based chatbots are increasingly influencing physics education due to their ability to interpret and respond to textual and visual inputs. This study evaluates the performance of two large multimodal model-based chatbots, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o on the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA), a conceptual physics inventory rich in visual representations such as vector fields, circuit diagrams, and graphs. Quantitative analysis shows that ChatGPT-4o outperforms both ChatGPT-4 and a large sample of university students, and demonstrates improvements in ChatGPT-4o's vision interpretation ability over its predecessor ChatGPT-4. However, qualitative analysis of ChatGPT-4o's responses reveals persistent challenges. We identified three types of difficulties in the chatbot's responses to tasks on BEMA: (1) difficulties with visual interpretation, (2) difficulties in providing correct physics laws or rules, and (3) difficulties with spatial coordination and application of physics representations. Spatial reasoning tasks, particularly those requiring the use of the right-hand rule, proved especially problematic. These findings highlight that the most broadly used large multimodal model-based chatbot, ChatGPT-4o, still exhibits significant difficulties in engaging with physics tasks involving visual representations. While the chatbot shows potential for educational applications, including personalized tutoring and accessibility support for students who are blind or have low vision, its limitations necessitate caution. On the other hand, our findings can also be leveraged to design assessments that are difficult for chatbots to solve.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought transformative changes to education, particularly in the field of physics, where complex concepts often pose significant challenges for students. This narrative review explores the role of AI in physics education by analyzing various tools and methods currently applied in learning environments, including intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive learning platforms, and interactive simulations. The study aims to assess the benefits and limitations of these technologies, as well as their potential to enhance learning outcomes through personalized, adaptive, and interactive experiences. Utilizing the SCOPUS database, a wide-ranging literature search was conducted with relevant keywords to capture studies that contribute to understanding AI’s impact on physics education. Results indicate that AI-driven tools significantly improve student engagement, accessibility, and understanding of abstract concepts by offering tailored learning pathways, real-time feedback, and immersive simulations. Additionally, AI provides alternative access to learning for students from diverse backgrounds, fostering inclusivity in physics education. However, challenges such as dependency on AI, ethical issues related to data security, and the potential digital divide are noted as barriers to effective implementation. To address these issues, the review recommends a balanced approach where AI complements traditional teaching methods, ensuring that it enhances rather than replaces human instruction. This review highlights the transformative potential of AI in physics education, advocating for further research to develop structured, ethical, and inclusive integration strategies that maximize the educational benefits of AI while addressing its limitations.

AB  - Abundant physics education research (PER) literature has been disseminated through academic publications. Over the years, the growing body of literature challenges Indonesian PER scholars to understand how the research community has progressed and possible future work that should be encouraged. Nevertheless, the previous traditional method of thematic analysis possesses limitations when the amount of PER literature exponentially increases. In order to deal with this plethora of publications, one of the machine learning (ML) algorithms from natural language processing (NLP) studies was employed in this paper to automate a thematic analysis of Indonesian PER literature that still needs to be explored within the community. One of the well-known NLP algorithms, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), was used in this study to extract Indonesian PER topics and their evolution between 2014 and 2021. A total of 852 papers (~4 to 8 pages each) were collectively downloaded from five international conference proceedings organized, peer reviewed, and published by Indonesian PER researchers. Before their topics were modeled through the LDA algorithm, our data corpus was preprocessed through several common procedures of established NLP studies. The findings revealed that LDA had thematically quantified Indonesian PER topics and described their distinct development over a certain period. The identified topics from this study recommended that the Indonesian PER community establish robust development in eight distinct topics to the present. Here, we commenced with an initial interest focusing on research on physics laboratories and followed the research-based instruction in late 2015. For the past few years, the Indonesian PER scholars have mostly studied 21st century skills which have given way to a focus on developing relevant educational technologies and promoting the interdisciplinary aspects of physics education. We suggest an open room for Indonesian PER scholars to address the qualitative aspects of physics teaching and learning that is still scant within the literature.

AB  - The well-known artificial intelligence-based chatbot ChatGPT-4 has become able to process image data as input in October 2023. We investigated its performance on the Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics to inform the physics education community of the current potential of using ChatGPT in the education process, particularly on tasks that involve graphical interpretation. We found that ChatGPT, on average, performed similarly to students taking a high-school level physics course, but with important differences in the distribution of the correctness of its responses, as well as in terms of the displayed"reasoning"and"visual"abilities. While ChatGPT was very successful at proposing productive strategies for solving the tasks on the test and expressed correct"reasoning"in most of its responses, it had difficulties correctly"seeing"graphs. We suggest that, based on its performance, caution and a critical approach are needed if one intends to use it in the role of a tutor, a model of a student, or a tool for assisting vision-impaired persons in the context of kinematics graphs.

Physics students highlight that the main use of gAI is for computational assistance, followed by its use as a valuable tool for simplifying complex physics concepts and providing alternative explanations. Overall, students do not trust gAI and cross-check its output. They agree with the department’s policy concerning gAI and express mixed views regarding its use for providing feedback and assessing students’ work. Differences across levels have been found, with the students’ confidence in effectively using gAI increasing with level, together with resistance to the possibility of using gAI to assess their work. Though online assessments remain popular, their popularity decreases with the level.

AB  - In the education system, problem-solving correctness is often inappropriately conflated with student learning. Advances in both Physics Education Research (PER) and Machine Learning (ML) provide the initial tools to develop a more meaningful and efficient measurement scheme for whether physics students are engaging in sensemaking: a learning process of figuring out the how and why for a particular phenomena. In this work, we contribute such a measurement scheme, which quantifies the evidence of students' physical sensemaking given their written explanations for their solutions to physics problems. We outline how the proposed human annotation scheme can be automated into a deployable ML model using language encoders and shared probabilistic classifiers. The procedure is scalable for a large number of problems and students. We implement three unique language encoders with logistic regression, and provide a deployability analysis on 385 real student explanations from the 2023 Introduction to Physics course at Tufts University. Furthermore, we compute sensemaking scores for all students, and analyze these measurements alongside their corresponding problem-solving accuracies. We find no linear relationship between these two variables, supporting the hypothesis that one is not a reliable proxy for the other. We discuss how sensemaking scores can be used alongside problem-solving accuracies to provide a more nuanced snapshot of student performance in physics class.

AB  - 'Intuitive physics' enables our pragmatic engagement with the physical world and forms a key component of 'common sense' aspects of thought. Current artificial intelligence systems pale in their understanding of intuitive physics, in comparison to even very young children. Here we address this gap between humans and machines by drawing on the field of developmental psychology. First, we introduce and open-source a machine-learning dataset designed to evaluate conceptual understanding of intuitive physics, adopting the violation-of-expectation (VoE) paradigm from developmental psychology. Second, we build a deep-learning system that learns intuitive physics directly from visual data, inspired by studies of visual cognition in children. We demonstrate that our model can learn a diverse set of physical concepts, which depends critically on object-level representations, consistent with findings from developmental psychology. We consider the implications of these results both for AI and for research on human cognition.

Consequently, there arises a need to develop a module focused on the incorporation of technology in physics education. The integration of technology within pedagogical modules refers to the practice of including various technological Implementations in educational content. This study aimed to investigate and rank the most efficient technological implementations for designing a pedagogical hybrid physics module for students in grades 9-12 in the Sultanate of Oman. A literature review was conducted concerning the integration of technology in hybrid learning and physics education. Qualitative and quantitative research methodologies were employed for data collection, the data were analyzed utilizing Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM). To establish the FD instrument, a panel of six experts was consulted through semi-structured interviews. This panel identified 13 significant technology Implementations for the development of the module. Subsequently, a group of 12 experts was surveyed to identify the essential technology Implementations. Consequently, four technology Implementations were excluded, while the accepted Implementations were then prioritized using FDM. The findings revealed that Mobile instant messaging claimed the top position, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) ranking at the lowest position.

AB  - In this research-to-practice full work, we will explore how innovative educational strategies can improve students' learning experiences. Specifically, we will focus on the early development of skills in engineering students, such as numerical manipulation for problem-solving, proficient spreadsheet management, experimental implementation, and mastery of mathematical modeling complemented by informed decision-making with graphics understanding and interpretation. The effective utilization of available technological resources helps to enhance the student learning experience and prepare them for the challenges in their engineering professional practice. Physics courses often present high rates of low academic performance, but these innovative approaches can enhance active student engagement and help nurture essential skills. However, integrating technology into innovative teaching methods can have implications; one seen recently is the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (G-AI) in many instruction courses; as a technology of easy access and manipulation, it can result in a confused tool if students don't have the appropriate instruction in its use. Therefore, educating students on the ethical and proper use of AI technology is crucial, guiding them in formulating relevant questions and accurately interpreting the results. To achieve this, we used the Learning Science and Engineering with Electronic Spreadsheets Cycle (LSEESC) methodology, which has been rigorously tested across various contexts over the last four years and has shown promising results. We will support its implementation with comprehensive guidance and use Artificial Intelligence as a prompt/chat tool (e.g., Chat GPT) as a supplementary tool. This strategy aimed to help students develop effective study habits for independent study sessions and promote autonomous learning. We examine how students ask for help from AI, including their choice of words and language. We will also investigate the effects of using casual or informal language and suggest guidelines for constructing practical questions. Our goal was to assist students in obtaining a better understanding and explanations of physics concepts and problem-solving exercises with the help of AI combined with a well-defined methodology, like the LSEESC, which promotes the development of skills like numerical manipulation, mathematical modeling, variables understanding, graphics generation, interpretation, and understanding. The learning intervention considers N = 140 students for working on the LSEESC methodology and using G-AI in physics courses during spring 2024, with students in the first year of academic engineering programs. The topics to evidence the learning process are kinematics and electrics. The results were analyzed with the Normalized Conceptual Gain (NCG) given a value of = 0.75 and 0.67, the Concentration Factor (CF), Rasch's index, and qualitative students' question formulation. This is particularly important because, in some instances, the results provided by G-AI were incorrect owing to the system's inability to detect specific implications that a human can easily recognize; the teacher explained the confused results presented by G-AI and student received the corresponding feedback about these issues with artificial intelligence.

AB  - The recent advancement of large language models presents numerous opportunities for teaching and learning. Despite widespread public debate regarding the use of large language models, empirical research on their opportunities and risks in education remains limited. In this work, we demonstrate the qualities and shortcomings of using ChatGPT 3.5 for physics task development by prospective teachers. In a randomized controlled trial, 26 prospective physics teacher students were divided into two groups: the first group used ChatGPT 3.5 to develop text-based physics tasks for four different concepts in the field of kinematics for 10th grade high school students, while the second group used a classical textbook to create tasks for the same concepts and target group. The results indicate no difference in task correctness, but students using the textbook achieved a higher clarity and more frequently embedded their questions in a meaningful context. Both groups adapted the level of task difficulty easily to the target group but struggled strongly with sufficient task specificity, i.e., relevant information to solve the tasks were missing. Students using ChatGPT for problem posing rated high system usability but experienced difficulties with output quality. These results provide insights into the opportunities and pitfalls of using large language models in education.

AB  - We propose a technique for performing deductive qualitative data analysis at scale on text-based data. Using a natural language processing technique known as text embeddings, we create vector-based representations of texts in a high-dimensional meaning space within which it is possible to quantify differences in meaning as vector distances. To apply the technique, we build off prior work that used topic modeling via latent Dirichlet allocation to thematically analyze 18 years of the Physics Education Research Conference Proceedings literature. We first extend this analysis through 2023. Next, we create embeddings of all texts and, using representative articles from the 10 topics found by the LDA analysis, define centroids in the meaning space. We calculate the distances between every article and centroid and use the inverted, scaled distances between these centroids and articles to create an alternate topic model. We benchmark this model against the LDA model results and show that this embeddings model recovers most of the trends from that analysis. Finally, to illustrate the versatility of the method, we define eight new topic centroids derived from a review of the physics education research literature by Docktor and Mestre and reanalyze the literature using these researcher-defined topics. Based on these analyses, we critically discuss the features, uses, and limitations of this method and argue that it holds promise for flexible deductive qualitative analysis of a wide variety of text-based data that avoids many of the drawbacks inherent to prior NLP methods.

AB  - The role of ChatGPT and higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) as predictors of physics inquiry among upper-secondary students has yet to be widely explored. Therefore, this research aimed to examine upper-secondary students' role in ChatGPT (convenience and quality (CQ), motivation and engagement (ME), and accuracy and trust (AT)) and HOTS as predictors of physics inquiry. Data were collected from 334 upper-secondary students in Indonesia through online questionnaires and analyzed with SPSS software using correlation and multiple linear regression. The results showed that CQ had the strongest correlation with HOTS, with significant predictors being response speed, concept linkage, and explanation quality. The ME dimension was also significantly correlated with HOTS, with increased motivation to learn and enjoyment in learning as key predictors. Lastly, the AT dimension significantly correlated with HOTS, where the accuracy of information and students' trust in it were essential predictors. These findings indicate that ChatGPT has the potential to enhance inquiry-based learning in physics by effectively supporting the development of HOTS.

AB  - The understanding of the physics course (PC) at the university level faces many challenges, highlighting the gap in mathematical knowledge and conceptual phenomenological analysis that affect the assimilation of more advanced physical concepts. The synergistic integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification into the teaching and learning process transforms this process into an engaging and collaborative experience, improving interaction and personalization of learning and incorporating game elements to increase student participation and motivation. The objective of this research was to measure the influence of the integration of ChatGPT, AI, and gamification on the academic results and motivation of students in the physics 1 course. A total of 188 students participated in this study: 98 students in the experimental group and 90 students in the control group. The grades obtained in the standardized evaluations were compared in both the partial exam and the final exam of the physics 1 course, and a Likert-type questionnaire was used for motivation. The results show a better academic performance (AP) of the students in the experimental group than the control group, which is statistically evidenced (p < 0.01). It also shows that students who developed the course using ChatGPT AI and gamification developed a more positive attitude towards interest, usefulness, self-efficacy, active participation, and personal satisfaction in the physics 1 course.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly and offers a variety of innovative applications across different fields, including education. However, in Malaysia, the implementation of AI technology in Teaching and Learning (PdP) is still limited, particularly in the subject of Physics. Students often face significant challenges in learning the topic of heat due to the complex and abstract concepts that hinder their mastery of the subject during the PdP process. This study aims to analyze the need for self-learning materials among Form Four students for the Physics subject. A quantitative survey design was used, employing questionnaires as the research instrument. These questionnaires were distributed to 30 secondary school Physics teachers in the Kota Setar district, selected through a simple random sampling technique. The results of the study show that the majority of teachers (73.3%) consider the topic of heat to be challenging for students. Additionally, all teachers (100%) agreed on the need to develop AI-based self-learning materials focused on the topic of heat (73.3%) supporting this initiative. Most teachers (90.9%) chose the subtopic of specific latent heat as the content for development. A large portion of teachers (83.3%) selected interactive modules as the appropriate type of AI-based self-learning materials. The most suitable learning technique was identified as mastery learning (86.7%). In terms of activity implementation, most teachers chose experiments (96.7%), while for assessment, the majority of teachers preferred interactive exercises (83.3%). In conclusion, there is a clear need to develop AI-based self-learning materials for the topic of heat among Form Four students, based on teachers' perceptions. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended to develop an AI-integrated comic-based e-module that can meet students' learning needs and present the topic of heat in a more comprehensible manner. This personalized learning material is expected to improve conceptual understanding among students.

 The emergence of conversational natural language processing models presents a significant challenge for Higher Education. In this work, we use the entirety of a UK Physics undergraduate (BSc with Honours) degree including all examinations and coursework to test if ChatGPT (GPT-4) can pass a degree. We adopt a “maximal cheating” approach wherein we permit ourselves to modify questions for clarity, split question up into smaller sub-components, expand on answers given – especially for long form written responses, obtaining references, and use of advanced coaching, plug-ins and custom instructions to optimize outputs. In general, there are only certain parts of the degree in question where GPT-4 fails. Explicitly these include compulsory laboratory elements, and the final project which is assessed by a viva. If these were no issue, then GPT-4 would pass with a grade of an upper second class overall. In general, coding tasks are performed exceptionally well, along with simple single-step solution problems. Multiple step problems and longer prose are generally poorer along with interdisciplinary problems. We strongly suggest that there is now a necessity to urgently re-think and revise assessment practice in physics – and other disciplines – due to the existence of AI such as GPT-4. We recommend close scrutiny of assessment tasks: only invigilated in-person examinations, vivas, laboratory skills testing (or “performances” in other disciplines), and presentations are not vulnerable to GPT-4, and urge consideration of how AI can be embedded within the disciplinary context.

AB  - The article reveals the trends in the use of digital technologies in teaching physics by summarizing scientific results over the past 20 years. To solve the problem, a bibliographic analysis of the sources of the scientometric database of the WOS was used with the involvement of the computer tool VOSviewer (for the construction and visualization of bibliographic data) as of June 2023. The tool was used to analyse publications by keywords (a network of connections is built on the basis of all keywords of given publications). Networks of connections of keywords were built according to the queries: “physics learning”, “physics education”, “physics teaching” and “technologies”, as well as “digital technologies in teaching physics”, “physics application”, “mobile physics learning”, “virtual physics laboratory”, “digital physics laboratory”, “virtual reality & physics”, “augmented reality & physics”. The landscape of the use of digital technologies in teaching physics is characterized by four aspects (general, technological, educational-motivational, educational-organizational). Modern trends in teaching physics are singled out: the use of environments where simulation, modelling, visualization, virtualization of physical processes, etc. are possible; increasing popularity of virtual, augmented and mixed reality tools; use of mobile applications for learning physics; using artificial intelligence to teach physics; organization of an educational environment based on mobile or online learning, where active learning methods are determined to be appropriate. The importance of developing young people's intellectual skills (computational skills, algorithmic thinking skills, modelling processes, etc.) and visual thinking for the successful mastery of various sections of physics has been confirmed. The demand for integration links between natural sciences, mathematics, engineering, and digital technologies for STEM education has been monitored. Recommendations for the training of physics teachers have been formulated.

AB  - Conceptual understanding is one of the keys in physics. The purpose of this research was to develop an artificial intelligence-based system used to assist instructors in evaluating students’ conceptual understanding essay test results. This research used a method with Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation (ADDIE) model (). The research subjects were lecturers and undergraduate students of physics education at the University of Jambi. Data collection was done through interviews and tests. The instruments used in this research were interview sheets and essay questions. The results of the feasibility test analysis showed that the hybrid automatic scoring system was overall suitable with an average score of 4.40 (very suitable category) in the aspects of software engineering and visual communication. In addition, the analysis of students’ conceptual understanding using the Hybrid Automatic Scoring System showed that only 21.9% of students had good conceptual understanding. The remaining 40.6% of students fell into the partial understanding category, 9.4% fell into the specific misconception category, and 28.2% had poor conceptual understanding. These results are not very different from the results of the manual analysis. The manual analysis showed that 21.9% of the students had good concept understanding, 40.6% had partial understanding, 12.5% had specific misconceptions, and 25% had poor concept understanding. These results indicate that the Automated Hybrid Scoring System can be used as an assessment tool for essay tests of conceptual understanding. The results of this research contribute in the form of a technology that can assist physics instructors in correcting, scoring, and providing feedback on physics test scores based on essay questions.

AB  - Chatbots based on state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) hold potential to act as beneficial educational tools. However, challenges to LLMs in education include concerns about not only the accuracy and interpretability of AI-generated text, but also about productive student engagement and positive user experience with LLM chatbots. In this paper, we introduce a physics education chatbot called NewtBot. We designed NewtBot to act as a personalized automated tutor to support secondary students’ learning as they complete physics tasks. NewtBot’s web interface has a modifiable back-end that internally prompts GPT-3.5 to produce different LLM behaviors. In a user study with German secondary school students (n=50), we evaluated student interactions with three different configurations of the GPT-3.5 back-end: a general-purpose “baseline” model, a setting-specific “tutor” model, and a problem-specific “feedback” model. We find that students had overall positive experiences using NewtBot, and that the setting-specific “tutor” model had the highest user experience ratings. Additionally, despite a majority of participants (72%) expressing apprehensions about using chatbots for school, 70% said they would use NewtBot to help with their physics school work.

AB  - Artificial intelligence, with its vast capabilities, has permeated various sectors of society, including education. This technological revolution has brought significant changes to both teaching and learning processes. This study aims to assess teachers' motivation to utilize AI-based tools, specifically ChatGPT, as a means of self-professional development to aid in the preparation of their pedagogical tasks. To this end, an online training session on the use of ChatGPT-4 was conducted with 41 physics teachers in the Fez-Meknes region of Morocco. During this training, teachers prepared lessons using both traditional and AI-enhanced methods. To measure their motivation towards the intelligent method, the IMMS-ARCS survey -based on four factors (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction)- was employed, a global Alpha Cronbach=0.901 indicates an excellent internal consistency between the 36 items. The results indicate that teachers generally exhibit a positive attitude towards using ChatGPT as an innovative tool that can assist and streamline their teaching tasks. Additionally, the findings reveal that the four motivational factors are positively correlated, with higher values of these predictors indicating greater overall teachers’ motivation to adopt ChatGPT-4 as an intelligent tool for self-development of a new skills to improve their competencies, ultimately, enhancing students’ outcomes.

Breakthroughs in machine learning are enabling, for example, the discovery of potentially habitable exoplanets beyond our solar system. The growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in science raises questions for scientists, philosophers, computer scientists … and educators. How will the scholarship and practice of science education respond to the growing role of artificial intelligence in science? Questions like ‘Can a robot be a scientist?’ can help stimulate students’ epistemic curiosity, about the nature of scientific knowledge, including the value and importance of apparently uniquely human attributes such as creativity. In this article we explain the development and delivery of a science lesson using the question ‘can a robot be a scientist?’ to explore the role of human creativity in scientific observation and classification, using resources and activities created for the citizen scientist project ‘Galaxy Zoo’.

AB  - Early childhood science education is crucial for developing scientific literacy, yet translating complex scientific concepts into age-appropriate content remains challenging for educators. Our study evaluates four leading Large Language Models (LLMs) - GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama - on their ability to generate preschool-appropriate scientific explanations across biology, chemistry, and physics. Through systematic evaluation by 30 nursery teachers using established pedagogical criteria, we identify significant differences in the models' capabilities to create engaging, accurate, and developmentally appropriate content. Unexpectedly, Claude outperformed other models, particularly in biological topics, while all LLMs struggled with abstract chemical concepts. Our findings provide practical insights for educators leveraging AI in early science education and offer guidance for developers working to enhance LLMs' educational applications. The results highlight the potential and current limitations of using LLMs to bridge the early childhood science literacy gap.

Its purpose is to generate answers to various questions as well as provide information, help solve problems and participate in conversations on a wide range of topics. This application is also widely used by students for the purposes of learning or cheating (e.g., writing essays or programming codes). Therefore, in this contribution, we evaluate the ability of ChatGPT to answer questions in quantum physics. That is, we develop a benchmark consisting of ten questions, whose difficulty is measured on a ten-grade scale. Then ChatGPT answers are evaluated and discussed. In this way, we can measure how well quantum-physics information is processed by this application. Our results demonstrate that ChatGPT does not notice subtle differences between physical terms, and can provide wrong answers to quantum-physics-related questions. It can also provide false mathematical formulas, claim that they are correct and confirm its answers. Note that this AI application is not sure of its answers, and in seven cases it apologizes for the first answer when a user has negated it. To sum up, AI represented by ChatGPT is only able to support students in the process of learning quantum physics at the fundamental level. Moreover, during collective exams in the future, where cheating and the use of AI by students may occur, exam questions should not be descriptive, but should be focused on solving computational problems.

AB  - Most of today’s educators are in no shortage of digital and online learning technologies available at their fingertips, ranging from Learning Management Systems such as Canvas, Blackboard, or Moodle, online meeting tools, online homework, and tutoring systems, exam proctoring platforms, computer simulations, and even virtual reality/augmented reality technologies. Furthermore, with the rapid development and wide availability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) services such as ChatGPT, we are just at the beginning of harnessing their potential to transform higher education. Yet, facing the large number of available options provided by cutting-edge technology, an imminent question on the mind of most educators is the following: how should I choose the technologies and integrate them into my teaching process so that they would best support student learning? We contemplate over these types of important and timely questions and share our reflections on evidence-based approaches to harnessing digital learning tools using a Self-regulated Engaged Learning Framework we have employed in our research in physics education that can be valuable for educators in other disciplines.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of ChatGPT, an AI-based language model, on student performance in a physics course. We conducted an experimental analysis with two cohorts of students in a second-semester engineering physics course. The control group (Physics 2 2022B) used traditional teaching methods, while the experimental group (Physics 2 2023A) integrated ChatGPT as a learning tool. Our results indicate that the use of ChatGPT led to a significant decrease in student performance, as evidenced by lower grades and negative Hake factors compared to the control group. In addition, a survey of students revealed conflicting perceptions of the usefulness of ChatGPT in teaching physics. While most recognized its usefulness in understanding concepts and providing information, concerns were raised about its potential to reduce critical thinking and independent learning. These findings suggest that while ChatGPT can be a useful tool, it should be used with caution and as a supplement to traditional teaching methods, rather than as a stand-alone solution. The study underlines the importance of critical and reflective use of AI tools in educational settings and highlights the irreplaceable role of teachers in providing comprehensive educational support.

AB  - This study examines the influence of using ChatGPT to enhance students' higher-order thinking Skills (HOTS), particularly within the context of the "Merdeka Belajar" (Freedom to Learn) era in Indonesia. This inquiry arises from Indonesian students' low literacy and numeracy skills, as indicated by the PISA assessment. Employing a quasi-experimental method, the research analyzes the changes in students' HOTS before and after the ChatGPT-assisted instruction intervention within the "Merdeka Belajar" curriculum framework. The study's findings reveal a significant improvement in students' HOTS within the experimental group that utilized ChatGPT, as compared to the control group. Data analysis underscores the positive impact of integrating ChatGPT into "Merdeka Belajar"-based teaching methods, substantially enhancing students' HOTS. These results align with prior literature highlighting the role of AI technology in advancing education and fostering higher-order thinking abilities. It is imperative to consider that the effective utilization of AI technology should be complemented by appropriate teaching approaches to prepare students for future challenges.  The implications of this research indicate that ChatGPT can be considered an innovative strategy to support Merdeka Belajar-based learning in Indonesia.

AB  - Interleaved practice enhances the memory and problem-solving ability of students in undergraduate courses. We introduce a personalized learning tool built on a Large Language Model (LLM) that can provide immediate and personalized attention to students as they complete homework containing problems interleaved from undergraduate physics courses. Our tool leverages the dimensional analysis method, enhancing students’ qualitative thinking and problem-solving skills for complex phenomena. Our approach combines LLMs for symbolic regression with dimensional analysis via prompt engineering and offers students a unique perspective to comprehend relationships between physics variables. This fosters a broader and more versatile understanding of physics and mathematical principles and complements a conventional undergraduate physics education that relies on interpreting and applying established equations within specific contexts. We test our personalized learning tool on the equations from Feynman’s lectures on physics. Our tool can correctly identify relationships between physics variables for most equations, underscoring its value as a complementary personalized learning tool for undergraduate physics students.

AB  - Effective problem-solving in physics extends beyond the mere application of mathematical formulas; it necessitates an understanding of how mathematical concepts connect to and reflect the physical world. A strong epistemological framework based on problem framing (PF) is essential for students, as it enables them to justify their mathematical decisions and recognize the relationship between abstract mathematics and real-world physical phenomena. This becomes increasingly important in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), where the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education is growing rapidly. This paper explores the impact of AI, specifically LLMs like ChatGPT, on upper-level students' PF in physics education. Building on existing models, in this exploratory theoretical paper, we propose a novel three-dimensional framework grounded in Situated Cognition Theory and Greeno's extended semantic model, aiming to elucidate how AI could influence students' epistemological framing during Cooperative Problem Solving activities (CPS). We advocate for instructors to encourage AI-assisted CPS to foster critical thinking and enhance student engagement with real-world scenarios. Preliminary results suggest that ChatGPT can aid in developing symbolic and visual languages within problem framing, though further research is needed to confirm these findings and investigate the potential of AI-driven intelligent tutoring systems for personalized learning.

AB  - Abstract We present a case study of a conversation between ourselves and an artificial intelligence-based chatbot ChatGPT. We asked the chatbot to respond to a basic physics question that will be familiar to most physics teachers: ‘ A teddy bear is thrown into the air. What is its acceleration in the highest point?’ The chatbot’s responses, while linguistically quite advanced, were unreliable in their correctness and often full of contradictions. We then attempted to engage in Socratic dialogue with the chatbot to resolve the errors and contradictions, but with little success. We found that ChatGPT is not yet good enough to be used as a cheating tool for physics students or as a physics tutor. However, we found it quite reliable in generating incorrect responses on which physics teachers could train assessment of student responses.

AB  - The teaching and learning in physics have undergone complete transformation through AI-driven intelligent tutoring systems adaptive learning stages and virtual labs that produce enhanced student involvement, interactive simulations and immediate feedback. The AI-powered Physics Education Technology (PhET) Interactive Simulations together with ChatGPT enables students to experiment with concepts by applying detailed explanations on complex physics theories to help abstract knowledge become more understandable. The deployment of AI resolves key educational obstacles since it delivers virtual labs alongside chatbots to make quality training more accessible for differential learners and resource-challenged students. Education integration of AI in physics faces major hurdles because of equity problems together with its expense burden and human resistance to adaptation and worries related to privacy of data and algorithmic discrimination. While AI instruments deliver better solutions for complex problems and enhanced understanding of concepts they do not reach scientific problem complexity levels which require human-like reasoning and heavy reliance on AI tools could hinder students' critical thinking abilities. Organizations receiving government financing along with training programs for teachers and ethical guidance must identify these challenges to establish high-quality physics education instruments. The supportive combination of AI with augmented reality and quantum computing enables educators and policymakers and researchers to collaborate for new educational breakthroughs. Responsible AI implementation enables physics education to achieve its goal of accessibility along with producing intriguing learning experiences which deliver effective 21st-century skill acquisition. The evolution emphasizes future progress in making traditional learning practices better through AI while developing careful implementation methods to help teacher reforms.

AB  - The aim of the study is to draw attention to the importance of using web-based intelligent tutoring systems (WBITS), which have emerged as a result of artificial neural networks and technological developments (communication technology), in the teaching of physics subjects. A WBITS is an intelligent tutoring system that exhibits behavior similar to that of a teacher in the traditional educational process (classroom education), offers a flexible teaching process, defined according to user preferences, and adaptable for a specific purpose. WBITSs make important contributions to distance education and classroom education processes, because they can be used online and offline. The importance of using WBITSs in teaching physics at undergraduate level was subsumed under five headings: i). Developments in technology and artificial neural networks and the interest of young people in technology have made it important to use WBITSs in undergraduate physics education. ii) The use of WBITSs has become important in following scientific developments in traditional (classroom) physics education and eliminating problems related to individual perception capacity and insufficient class hours. iii). Online (remote) access to physics subjects via WBITSs contributes to equality of opportunity in education. iv). More time can be devoted to practice and the discussion of deeper (advanced) subjects in the classroom when basic physics subjects are taught at undergraduate (university) level using WBITSs. v). Limitations in distance physics education can be reduced using WBITSs.

AB  - Reflecting in written form on one’s teaching enactments has been considered a facilitator for teachers’ professional growth in university-based preservice teacher education. Writing a structured reflection can be facilitated through external feedback. However, researchers noted that feedback in preservice teacher education often relies on holistic, rather than more content-based, analytic feedback because educators oftentimes lack resources (e.g., time) to provide more analytic feedback. To overcome this impediment to feedback for written reflection, advances in computer technology can be of use. Hence, this study sought to utilize techniques of natural language processing and machine learning to train a computer-based classifier that classifies preservice physics teachers’ written reflections on their teaching enactments in a German university teacher education program. To do so, a reflection model was adapted to physics education. It was then tested to what extent the computer-based classifier could accurately classify the elements of the reflection model in segments of preservice physics teachers’ written reflections. Multinomial logistic regression using word count as a predictor was found to yield acceptable average human-computer agreement (F1-score on held-out test dataset of 0.56) so that it might fuel further development towards an automated feedback tool that supplements existing holistic feedback for written reflections with data-based, analytic feedback.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has shown significant promise, yet the effective personalization of learning, particularly in physics education, remains a challenge. This paper proposes Physics-STAR, a framework for large language model (LLM)- powered tutoring system designed to address this gap by providing personalized and adaptive learning experiences for high school students. Our study evaluates Physics-STAR against traditional teacher-led lectures and generic LLM tutoring through a controlled experiment with 12 high school sophomores. Results showed that Physics-STAR increased students' average scores and efficiency on conceptual, computational, and on informational questions. In particular, students' average scores on complex information problems increased by 100% and their efficiency increased by 5.95%. By facilitating step-by-step guidance and reflective learning, Physics-STAR helps students develop critical thinking skills and a robust comprehension of abstract concepts. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven personalized tutoring systems to transform physics education. As LLM continues to advance, the future of student-centered AI in education looks promising, with the potential to significantly improve learning outcomes and efficiency.

We first summarise existing research on the performance of a popular LLM-based chatbot (ChatGPT) on physics tasks. We then give a basic account of how LLMs work, illustrate essential features of their functioning, and discuss their strengths and limitations. Equipped with this knowledge, we discuss some challenges with generating useful output with ChatGPT-4 in the context of introductory physics, paying special attention to conceptual questions and problems. We then provide a condensed overview of relevant literature on prompt engineering and demonstrate through illustrative examples how selected prompt-engineering techniques can be employed to improve ChatGPT-4’s output on conceptual introductory physics problems. Qualitatively studying these examples provides additional insights into ChatGPT’s functioning and its utility in physics problem-solving. Finally, we consider how insights from the paper can inform the use of LLMs in the teaching and learning of physics.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have grabbed significant attention from diverse technical fields due to their impressive performance on a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Although these models excel in various generative tasks, they lack the robust reasoning ability required to solve complex mathematics and physics problems. Despite their inherent limitations, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) based chatbots, powered by these large language models, are being rapidly adopted by students in physics and other technical fields. In this project, we assessed the ability of various generative AI-based models to solve Physics problems. We asked currently popular AI models to solve Physics questions from a final board exam of class 12 of the Higher Secondary Education Board (HSEB) of Nepal. We then evaluated the AI-written solutions by the subject matter experts. We found that the gpt-4o model by OpenAI performed the best, securing 90% among the models studied. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of these models and compare their performance as evaluated by a University Physics professor. We will also discuss the risks and benefits of their use in higher education.

AB  - Nowadays, the fast evolution of educational technology boosted by AI tools like ChatGPT urges to understand how future educators perceive its use in the education system. This study evaluates the knowledge and attitudes towards ChatGPT of future teachers enrolled in science (Biology, Physics, Chemistry) and humanities (Spanish Language and Literature) modules at the University of León (Spain). To achieve this goal, a non-experimental, descriptive, cross sectional, and quantitative research design has been carried out. A sample of 70 Master of Secondary Education students completed a validated questionnaire. The aim was to gauge the level of their prior knowledge about ChatGPT and to analyze their double perception as both students and future educators. Our findings indicate that prospective secondary educators generally perceive ChatGPT as a beneficial tool for students. As future teachers, they identify certain advantages in using tools like ChatGPT to enhance teaching performance. However, they are concerned about the difficulty of detecting plagiarism and the potential decrease in students’ critical thinking skills. These two aspects are viewed as threats to the quality of the educational system. This study highlights differences between future science and humanities teachers. Notably, educators with a humanities background are more worried about information quality, creativity, and academic integrity compared to their science counterparts. This work highlights the need to address customized strategies for incorporating AI into the educational system through specific training that takes into account the prior education of students and teachers.

AB  - Machine learning models were constructed to predict student performance in an introductory mechanics class at a large land-grant university in the United States using data from 2061 students. Students were classified as either being at risk of failing the course (earning a D or F) or not at risk (earning an A, B, or C). The models focused on variables available in the first few weeks of the class which could potentially allow for early interventions to help at-risk students. Multiple types of variables were used in the model: in-class variables (average homework and clicker quiz scores), institutional variables [college grade point average (GPA)], and noncognitive variables (self-efficacy). The substantial imbalance between the pass and fail rates of the course, with only about 10% of students failing, required modification to the machine learning algorithms. Decision threshold tuning and upsampling were successful in improving performance for at-risk students. Logistic regression combined with a decision threshold tuned to maximize balanced accuracy yielded the strongest classifier, with a DF accuracy of 83% and an ABC accuracy of 81%. Measures of variable importance involving changes in balanced accuracy identified homework grades, clicker grades, college GPA, and the fraction of college classes successfully completed as the most important variables in predicting success in introductory physics. Noncognitive variables added little predictive power to the models. Classification models with performance near the best-performing models using the full set of variables could be constructed with very few variables (homework average, clicker scores, and college GPA) using straightforward to implement algorithms, suggesting the application of these technologies may be fairly easy to include in many physics classes.

AB  - Students tend to retain naive understandings of concepts such as energy and force even after completing school and entering college. We developed a learning environment called the Virtual Physics System (ViPS) to help students master these concepts in the context of pulleys, a class of simple machines that are difficult to assemble and use in the real world. Several features make the ViPS noteworthy: it combines simulation and tutoring, it customizes tutoring to address common misconceptions, and it employs a pedagogical strategy that identifies student misconceptions and guides students in problem solving through virtual experimentation. This paper presents the ViPS and describes studies in which we evaluated its efficacy and compared learning from the ViPS with learning from constructing and experimenting with real pulleys. Our results indicate that the ViPS is effective in helping students learn and remediate their misconceptions, and that virtual experimentation in the ViPS is more effective than real experimentation with pulleys.

AB  - The concepts of physics play an important role in many fields of people’s lives, and physics learning is abstract, challenging, and sometimes intimidating [1]. However, how to motivate students to learn physics in a fun way becomes a question. This paper develops a gamic, interactive, educational application to allow students to learn abstract physics in an illustrative way. We have implemented a visual physics lab by using a 3D game engine supporting the immersive environment of visualization and providing a playful learning tool for physics experiments at the same time [2].

AB  - This study aims to determine the influence of distance asynchronous teaching of Physics-I topics via intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) on academic achievement and permanence. A Web-based learning environment was created by use of an ITS called “Turkish Intelligent Tutoring System” (TURKZOS) for such Physics-I units as work, energy, and conservation of energy. The experimental group of the study consisted of 26 students who had computer and Internet access and participated in the study voluntarily. The achievement test developed by the researchers was used for collecting data. This test was conducted as pre-test and post-test before and after the experimental procedure respectively. The same test was administered to measure permanence 45 days later following the performance of the post-test. The obtained data were analyzed via paired t-test. Mean pre-test score was found to be 23.88, and mean post-test score was found to be 73.80. Mean permanence test, on the other hand, was found to be 71.88. When mean pre-test and post-test scores were compared, a significant difference was identified in favor of the mean post-test score (p < 0.05). In addition, a significant difference was detected between mean permanence test and pre-test scores (p < 0.005). The mean permanence test score was higher than the mean pre-test score. It was concluded that intelligent learning environments created through Web-based tutoring systems have a positive influence on academic achievement and permanence in physics teaching.

The curriculum consists of 5-day units on Data Analytics, Decision trees, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Transfer learning that follow a scaffolded learning progression consisting of introductions to concepts grounded in everyday experiences, hands-on activities, interactive web-based tools, and inspecting and modifying the code used to build, train and test AI models within Google Colab notebooks. The participants in the PD program were secondary school teachers from the Southwest and North-east regions of the United States who represented a variety of STEM disciplines: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Engi-neering, and Mathematics. We share findings on teacher outcomes from the implementation of two one-week PD workshops during the summer of 2021 and share suggestions for improvements provided by teachers. We conclude with a discussion of affordances and challenges encountered in preparing teachers to integrate AI education into disciplinary classrooms.

AB  - Instructor’s feedback plays a critical role in students’ development of conceptual understanding and reasoning skills. However, grading student written responses and providing personalized feedback can take a substantial amount of time, especially in large enrollment courses. In this study, we explore using GPT-3.5 to write feedback on students’ written responses to conceptual questions with prompt engineering and few-shot learning techniques. In stage I, we used a small portion (n=20) of the student responses on one conceptual question to iteratively train GPT to generate feedback. Four of the responses paired with human-written feedback were included in the prompt as examples for GPT. We tasked GPT to generate feedback for another 16 responses and refined the prompt through several iterations. In stage II, we gave four student researchers (one graduate and three undergraduate researchers) the 16 responses as well as two versions of feedback, one written by the authors and the other by GPT. Students were asked to rate the correctness and usefulness of each feedback and to indicate which one was generated by GPT. The results showed that students tended to rate the feedback by human and GPT equally on correctness, but they all rated the feedback by GPT as more useful. Additionally, the success rates of identifying GPT’s feedback were low, ranging from 0.1 to 0.6. In stage III, we tasked GPT to generate feedback for the rest of the students’ responses (n=65). The feedback messages were rated by four instructors based on the extent of modification needed if they were to give the feedback to students. All four instructors rated approximately 70% (ranging from 68% to 78%) of the feedback statements needing only minor or no modification. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using generative artificial intelligence (AI) as an assistant to generate feedback for student written responses with only a relatively small number of examples in the prompt. An AI assistant can be one of the solutions to substantially reduce time spent on grading student written responses.

AB  - With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), its potential implications for higher education have become a focal point of interest. This study delves into the capabilities of AI in physics education and offers actionable AI policy recommendations. Using openAI’s flagship gpt-3.5-turbo large language model (LLM), we assessed its ability to answer 1337 physics exam questions spanning general certificate of secondary education (GCSE), A-Level, and introductory university curricula. We employed various AI prompting techniques: Zero Shot, in context learning, and confirmatory checking, which merges chain of thought reasoning with reflection. The proficiency of gpt-3.5-turbo varied across academic levels: it scored an average of 83.4% on GCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions, with an overall average of 59.9% using the most effective prompting technique. In a separate test, the LLM’s accuracy on 5000 mathematical operations was found to be 45.2%. When evaluated as a marking tool, the LLM’s concordance with human markers averaged at 50.8%, with notable inaccuracies in marking straightforward questions, like multiple-choice. Given these results, our recommendations underscore caution: while current LLMs can consistently perform well on physics questions at earlier educational stages, their efficacy diminishes with advanced content and complex calculations. LLM outputs often showcase novel methods not in the syllabus, excessive verbosity, and miscalculations in basic arithmetic. This suggests that at university, there’s no substantial threat from LLMs for non-invigilated physics questions. However, given the LLMs’ considerable proficiency in writing physics essays and coding abilities, non-invigilated examinations of these skills in physics are highly vulnerable to automated completion by LLMs. This vulnerability also extends to pysics questions pitched at lower academic levels. It is thus recommended that educators be transparent about LLM capabilities with their students, while emphasizing caution against overreliance on their output due to its tendency to sound plausible but be incorrect.

The application aims to cater to the learning needs of students with diversity of the background, particularly students with little or weak background. The overall design architecture and principles are discussed, focusing on the rationale and design of the gamified elements that have been incorporated within the application, namely: (i) incremental difficulties, (ii) points and streaks, (iii) leaderboard, and (iv) gamified and animated user interface. Particularly, the gamified elements are considered through the lens of the ‘Head, Hands, and Heart’ of the students, with the objective to first encourage and motivate participation, stimulate practice, and strengthen the students’ domain knowledge of physics. In this article, an architecture to incorporate AI program into the web-based gamification platform by including various AI models (learner model, pedagogy model and domain model) is proposed. With the architecture, we aim to create a personalized tutor that provide effective and unique learning experience to help a learner achieve learning objectives. The AI enabled gamification platform also serves as an efficient feedback tool to teacher for optimization and redesigning of curriculum to best suit the need of individual learner.

AB  - Virtual Laboratories (VLs) have to overcome important challenges to improve student knowledge, understanding and motivation. This research aims to test the hypothesis that, through adding features of serious games to VLs and integrating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, an enhancement of student motivation, knowledge and understanding can be attained. This work introduces the Olympia architecture, which is based on a previous architecture that combines VLs and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). In addition, Olympia enables the combination of serious games with ITSs, resulting in an educational game virtual laboratory (GVL). The GVL provides affective feedback through sound, a more engaging look-and-feel and defines student actions through the game mechanics module. Olympia was tested in a case study on teaching linear momentum in an undergraduate Physics course. For the first evaluation, a VL and a GVL were implemented. The results showed that students were motivated and learned in a similar way with both the GVL and VL environments. Later, several additions were integrated in both environments: the probabilistic student model was improved, tutorial videos were added, and the feedback was refined. For the second evaluation the results suggest that using the GVL resulted in higher learning gains than using VL.

 The latest advances in science and technology have resulted in great advances in artificial intelligence (AI), including the creation of chatbots. Chatbots simulate human conversation and allow humans to ask questions and receive answers based on a large volume of electronically stored information. Faculties of universities around the world are trying to come to grips with the availability of AI tools, such as chatbots, and are debating the ethical and moral questions surrounding the use of AI in education. This paper presents the results of a study which intended to answer three research questions. RQ1: how familiar are students with AI and tools that utilize it? RQ2: are students aware of the ethical issues involving AI and are they familiar with the university’s policies regarding the use of AI? RQ3: can ChatGPT be used as an efficient tool to teach science majors to code in Python? In this project, a chatbot was used to instruct students on the use of the Python programming language. Introductory college physics students were tasked with using an AI chatbot, ChatGPT (chat generative pre-trained transformer), to learn how to effectively code in the coding program, Python. Before using ChatGPT to code, the students were given a pre-test survey to determine their skill level in Python coding and their familiarity of AI and issues pertaining the use of AI. After completing exercises in Python coding using ChatGPT, a post-test survey was conducted to determine how well the students have learned to code in Python as well as how effective ChatGPT was in assisting their study.

AB  - Abstract The pretrained large language models have been widely tested for their performance on some challenging tasks including arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. Recently how to combine LLMs with prompting techniques has attracted lots of researchers to propose their models to automatically solve math word problems. However, most research works focus on solving math problems at the elementary school level and few works aim to solve problems in science disciplines, e.g., Physics. In this exploratory study, we discussed the potential pedagogical benefits of using ChatGPT in physics and demonstrated how to prompt ChatGPT in solving physics problems. The results suggest that ChatGPT is able to solve some physics calculation problems, explain solutions, and generate new exercises at a human level.

AB  - Language is an important resource for physicists and learners of physics to construe physical phenomena and processes, and communicate ideas. Moreover, any physics-related instructional setting is inherently language-bound, and physics literacy is fundamentally related to comprehending and producing both physics-specific and general language. Consequently, characterizing physics language and understanding language use in physics are important goals for research on physics learning and instructional design. Qualitative physics education research offers a variety of insights into the characteristics of language and language use in physics such as the differences between everyday language and scientific language, or metaphors used to convey concepts. However, qualitative language analysis fails to capture distributional (i.e. quantitative) aspects of language use and is resource-intensive to apply in practice. Integrating quantitative and qualitative language analysis in physics education research might be enhanced by recently advanced artificial intelligence-based technologies such as large language models, as these models were found to be capable to systematically process and analyse language data. Large language models offer new potentials in some language-related tasks in physics education research and instruction, yet they are constrained in various ways. In this scoping review, we seek to demonstrate the multifaceted nature of language and language use in physics and answer the question what potentials and limitations artificial intelligence-based methods such as large language models can have in physics education research and instruction on language and language use.

AB  - Generative AI technologies such as large language models show novel potential to enhance educational research. For example, generative large language models were shown to be capable of solving quantitative reasoning tasks in physics and concept tests such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). Given the importance of such concept inventories for physics education research, and the challenges in developing them such as field testing with representative populations, this study seeks to examine to what extent a generative large language model could be utilized to generate a synthetic dataset for the FCI that exhibits content-related variability in responses. We use the recently introduced ChatGPT based on the GPT 4 generative large language model and investigate to what extent ChatGPT could solve the FCI accurately (RQ1) and could be prompted to solve the FCI as if it were a student belonging to a different cohort (RQ2). Furthermore, we study, to what extent ChatGPT could be prompted to solve the FCI as if it were a student having a different force- and mechanics-related preconception (RQ3). In alignment with other research, we found that ChatGPT could accurately solve the FCI. We furthermore found that prompting ChatGPT to respond to the inventory as if it belonged to a different cohort yielded no variance in responses, however, responding as if it had a certain preconception introduced much variance in responses that approximate real human responses on the FCI in some regards.Received 28 July 2023Accepted 3 October 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.19.020150Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

AB  - Massive pre-trained language models have garnered attention and controversy due to their ability to generate human-like responses: attention due to their frequent indistinguishability from human-generated phraseology and narratives, and controversy due to the fact that their convincingly presented arguments and facts are frequently simply false. Just how human-like are these responses when it comes to dialogues about physics, in particular about the standard content of introductory physics courses? This study explores that question by having ChatGTP, the pre-eminent language model in 2023, work through representative assessment content of an actual calculus-based physics course and grading the responses in the same way human responses would be graded. As it turns out, ChatGPT would narrowly pass this course while exhibiting many of the preconceptions and errors of a beginning learner.

AB  - In the age of modern technology, generative artificial intelligience-powered chatbots offer a variety of uses for different purposes. Undoubtedly, ChatGPT is one of the most widely used chatbots in science education. In this paper, we review the implementations of chatbots, focusing particularly in teaching and learning physics and chemistry. Their roles in the context of science education are classified as tutee, tutor, and tool. We found the development of ChatGPT to be quite impressive. As a tutee, the latest version of ChatGPT is a fast learner, capable of passing standard tests and providing accurate scientific answers using approaches like Chain-of-Thought and Socratic-style dialogue. As a tutor, it can help students learn through classroom teaching techniques such as scaffolding and enhance critical thinking by acting as a personal tutor that offers instantaneous feedback. As a tool, ChatGPT can assist in reviewing students’ handwritten homework, drafting scientific writing, and generating code for science programming. Although ChatGPT offers many benefits, it can sometimes provide inaccurate information, necessitating human oversight in science education. Importantly, students should be taught to critically assess the responses provided by ChatGPT and understand its ethical use to ensure effective utilization.

In this section, we explore the correlation between the logic underlying the responses generated by two chatbots for problems related to electrical circuits and the well-known alternative conceptions prevalent in the field of science education. To achieve this, we employed a methodology involving the presentation of ten questions to the chatbots, followed by an analysis of their answers in conjunction with established knowledge in physics and the Theory of Conceptual Fields. The objective was to bridge the gap between AI-generated responses and human responses. Our primary findings reveal a close resemblance between these two groups. This initial endeavor lays the foundation for developing an investigative methodology that will facilitate a comprehensive understanding and categorization of the various forms of interaction between students and chatbots.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms have recently been used to predict students' performance in an introductory physics class. The prediction model classified students as those likely to receive an A or B or students likely to receive a grade of C, D, F or withdraw from the class. Early prediction could better allow the direction of educational interventions and the allocation of educational resources. However, the performance metrics used in that study become unreliable when used to classify whether a student would receive an A, B or C (the ABC outcome) or if they would receive a D, F or withdraw (W) from the class (the DFW outcome) because the outcome is substantially unbalanced with between 10\% to 20\% of the students receiving a D, F, or W. This work presents techniques to adjust the prediction models and alternate model performance metrics more appropriate for unbalanced outcome variables. These techniques were applied to three samples drawn from introductory mechanics classes at two institutions ($N=7184$, $1683$, and $926$). Applying the same methods as the earlier study produced a classifier that was very inaccurate, classifying only 16\% of the DFW cases correctly; tuning the model increased the DFW classification accuracy to 43\%. Using a combination of institutional and in-class data improved DFW accuracy to 53\% by the second week of class. As in the prior study, demographic variables such as gender, underrepresented minority status, first-generation college student status, and low socioeconomic status were not important variables in the final prediction models.

AB  - Data is the primary source to scaffold physics teaching and learning for teachers and students, mainly reported through in-class assessment. Machine learning (ML) is an axis of artificial intelligence (AI) study that immensely attracts the development of physics education research (PER). ML is built to predict students’ learning that can support students’ success in an effective physics achievement. In this paper, two ML algorithms, logistic regression and random forest, were trained and compared to predict students’ achievement in high school physics (N = 197). Data on students’ achievement was harvested from in-class assessments administered by a physics teacher regarding knowledge (cognitive) and psychomotor during the 2020/2021 academic year. Three assessment points of knowledge and psychomotor were employed to predict students’ achievement on a dichotomous scale on the final term examination. Combining in-class assessment of knowledge and psychomotor, we could discover the plausible performance of students’ achievement prediction using the two algorithms. Knowledge assessment was a determinant in predicting high school physics students’ achievement. Findings reported by this paper recommended open room for the implementation of ML for educational practice and its potential contribution to supporting physics teaching and learning.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (gen-AI) has become ubiquitous in daily life, including classroom environments where students are using it to assist them on their coursework. Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions. The findings demonstrate a connection between using gen-AI and engaging in creative processes, and the implications point to strategies for supporting student usage of gen-AI.

In this study we investigate methods using NLP and ML to assess and understand students' argumentation. Specifically, we investigate the use of topic modeling to analyze student essays of argumentation after solving a problem in the recitation section of an introductory calculus-based physics course four semesters. We report on the emergent themes present in each semester.

AB  - This study explores the design and implementation of symbolic regression (SR)-integrated physics classes (SRPC) to encourage students to actively engage in scientific discovery using real-world data. The classes, involving 18 second-year high school students in South Korea, were conducted over six hours across two weeks. Students completed a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)-based survey before and after the classes, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with five students. Analysis of both survey and pre-interview data revealed that, despite a limited understanding of machine learning (ML) principles, students displayed a positive attitude towards its use in scientific research and expressed a behavioral intention to use it. However, post-interviews indicated a shift in students' perceptions towards a more critical awareness of ML's limitations, underscoring the importance of understanding underlying principles. While students responded positively to the data-driven research experience, this response was limited to the novelty effect of the new scientific approach. Additionally, the findings suggest that employing a more diverse range of phenomena in SRPC, where universal laws are not yet established, may better support genuine scientific discovery using SR.

Then, the physics teaching system is modeled based on the artificial neuron model and recurrent neural network, and the attention mechanism is used to improve the overall generalization performance of the model. Finally, the application effect of the physics teaching system is compared through empirical evidence. The results show that there is a deviation in the mean value of the two classes; the average score of the experimental class is 75.552 points, and the average score of the control class is 65.910 points, and there is a difference of 9.642 points between the two classes’ mean values. The data show that applying a physics teaching system can improve the learning status quo of students’ mechanical imitation, help students better master knowledge, enhance students’ ability to use information technology and achieve better teaching results than traditional teaching.

AB  - Large language models have been shown to excel in many different tasks across disciplines and research sites. They provide novel opportunities to enhance educational research and instruction in different ways such as assessment. However, these methods have also been shown to have fundamental limitations. These relate, among others, to hallucinating knowledge, explainability of model decisions, and resource expenditure. As such, more conventional machine learning algorithms might be more convenient for specific research problems because they allow researchers more control over their research. Yet, the circumstances in which either conventional machine learning or large language models are preferable choices are not well understood. This study seeks to answer the question to what extent either conventional machine learning algorithms or a recently advanced large language model performs better in assessing students' concept use in a physics problem-solving task. We found that conventional machine learning algorithms in combination outperformed the large language model. Model decisions were then analyzed via closer examination of the models' classifications. We conclude that in specific contexts, conventional machine learning can supplement large language models, especially when labeled data is available.

AB  - This study explores the integration of ChatGPT as a teaching assistant in physics education, emphasizing its potential to transform traditional pedagogical approaches. ChatGPT facilitates interactive and inquiry-based learning grounded in constructivist learning theory, allowing students to engage actively in experiments and better grasp abstract concepts through hands-on activities. The AI's adaptive dialogue systems promote socio-constructivist learning by encouraging social interaction and personalized feedback, which is essential for addressing individual learning gaps and enhancing student engagement. ChatGPT's ability to simulate real-world physics problems and provide immediate feedback fosters experiential learning, making complex concepts more accessible and promoting critical thinking skills. By offering tailored interventions and adapting to individual learning paces, ChatGPT supports a personalized educational experience that caters to the unique needs of each student. This adaptability is particularly beneficial in physics education, where students often struggle with abstract concepts and require immediate clarification to progress effectively. The paper concludes that the synthesis of generative AI and pedagogy has the potential to reshape science education, fostering deeper understanding and curiosity among students. By leveraging innovative methodologies and augmented data, ChatGPT enriches teacher-student interactions, creating a comprehensive educational experience that promotes a culture of curiosity and exploration, thereby nurturing future scientists and engineers. Ultimately, the integration of ChatGPT into physics education offers a valuable opportunity to enhance student engagement and understanding of scientific concepts through interactive and personalized support.

The collected data were analyzed using numbers of frequencies and percentages. The results showed that there was a strong demand and satisfaction with the use of this technology in explaining the physics lessons. The obtained results showed that the AI had great potential in the world of education, one of which was in learning physics. AI could also help improve students' understanding and comprehension skills, with 42% strongly agreeing and 30% agreeing, making the overall approval percentage 72%. In this study, the percentage between neutral and disagreeing was 28%.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of Japanese honorifics on the responses of large language models (LLMs) when explaining the law of conservation of momentum. We analyzed the outputs of six state-of-the-art AI models, including variations of ChatGPT, Coral, and Gemini, using 14 different honorific forms. Our findings reveal that honorifics significantly affect the quality, consistency, and formality of AI-generated responses, demonstrating LLMs' ability to interpret and adapt to social context cues embedded in language. Notable variations were observed across different models, with some emphasizing historical context and derivations, while others focused on intuitive explanations. The study highlights the potential for using honorifics to adjust the depth and complexity of AI-generated explanations in educational contexts. Furthermore, the responsiveness of AI models to cultural linguistic elements underscores the importance of considering cultural factors in AI development for educational applications. These results open new avenues for research in AI-assisted education and cultural adaptation in AI systems, with significant implications for personalizing learning experiences and developing culturally sensitive AI tools for global education.

Quantitative data of this study were obtained through objective tests (pretest-posttest) based on Bloom's Taxonomy. The results of this study indicate that the application of Edmodo can improve students' cognitive abilities in physics. With the increase in students' physics cognitive abilities in learning, the learning outcomes of previously low students increased significantly. Therefore, it is recommended that AI-Edmodo improve students' physics cognitive abilities in learning physics on the topic of work and energy.

AB  - The promise and difficulties of language model-based approaches for physics teaching were assessed in this study. This study evaluates how well ChatGPT and BingChat, two state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs), perform when answering high school physics questions on Vietnamese exams from 2019 to 2023. When we compared the results of the LLMs with the scores of Vietnamese students, we discovered that ChatGPT and BingChat both perform worse than Vietnamese students, proving that LLMs are not yet capable of fully replacing human intellect in the field of physics teaching. The outcomes also showed that neither LLM is capable of responding to questions at the high application levels. In terms of accuracy, BingChat typically surpassed ChatGPT, although ChatGPT showed more stability. Our research suggests that LLMs can help students and teachers during learning and teaching activities, particularly by offering immediate feedback and individualized learning experiences.

AB  - We investigate the multilingual and multimodal performance of a large language model-based artificial intelligence (AI) system, GPT-4o, using a diverse set of physics concept inventories spanning multiple languages and subject categories. The inventories, sourced from the PhysPort website, cover classical physics topics such as mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, and thermodynamics, as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, astronomy, mathematics, and laboratory skills. Unlike previous text-only studies, we uploaded the inventories as images to reflect what a student would see on paper, thereby assessing the system's multimodal functionality. Our results indicate variation in performance across subjects, with laboratory skills standing out as the weakest. We also observe differences across languages, with English and European languages showing the strongest performance. Notably, the relative difficulty of an inventory item is largely independent of the language of the survey. When comparing AI results to existing literature on student performance, we find that the AI system outperforms average post-instruction undergraduate students in all subject categories except laboratory skills. Furthermore, the AI performs worse on items requiring visual interpretation of images than on those that are purely text-based.

AB  - Abstract Computer-based analysis of preservice teachers’ written reflections could enable educational scholars to design personalized and scalable intervention measures to support reflective writing. Algorithms and technologies in the domain of research related to artificial intelligence have been found to be useful in many tasks related to reflective writing analytics such as classification of text segments. However, mostly shallow learning algorithms have been employed so far. This study explores to what extent deep learning approaches can improve classification performance for segments of written reflections. To do so, a pretrained language model (BERT) was utilized to classify segments of preservice physics teachers’ written reflections according to elements in a reflection-supporting model. Since BERT has been found to advance performance in many tasks, it was hypothesized to enhance classification performance for written reflections as well. We also compared the performance of BERT with other deep learning architectures and examined conditions for best performance. We found that BERT outperformed the other deep learning architectures and previously reported performances with shallow learning algorithms for classification of segments of reflective writing. BERT starts to outperform the other models when trained on about 20 to 30% of the training data. Furthermore, attribution analyses for inputs yielded insights into important features for BERT’s classification decisions. Our study indicates that pretrained language models such as BERT can boost performance for language-related tasks in educational contexts such as classification.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in physics education is gaining traction, driven by their potential to enhance learning experiences and outcomes. This study aims to investigate the use of AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, in solving physics problems and enhancing educational practices. Utilizing a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, the research identifies current trends and practical applications of AI in physics education. The results indicate that AI tools effectively support lesson planning, introduce innovative teaching methodologies, and assist in solving complex physics problems, significantly enhancing problem-solving skills and personalized learning experiences. However, challenges such as inaccuracies in handling advanced content, the lack of useful visual aids, and the need for human intervention to ensure the completeness and accuracy of AI-generated content were noted. Personal experiences, supplemented by an interview with a thermodynamics lecturer, revealed that while ChatGPT can simplify complex concepts and improve comprehension, it could not replace the mentorship and nuanced feedback provided by human educators. The study concludes with recommendations for integrating AI tools into physics education, emphasizing the need for balanced integration with traditional teaching methods, improved AI literacy among educators and students, and future developments focusing on personalized learning and enhanced visualization capabilities. The findings demonstrate the transformative potential of AI in physics education and highlight the importance of addressing its limitations to maximize educational outcomes.

AB  - As a result of the pandemic, many physics courses moved online. Alongside, the popularity of Internet-based problem-solving sites and forums rose. With the emergence of large language models, another shift occurred. One year into the public availability of these models, how has online help-seeking behavior among introductory physics students changed, and what is the effect of different patterns of online resource usage? In a mixed-method approach, we investigate student choices and their impact on assessment components of an online introductory physics course for scientists and engineers. We find that students still mostly rely on traditional Internet resources and that their usage strongly influences the outcome of low-stake unsupervised quizzes. We empirically found distinct clusters of help-seeking and resource-usage patterns among the students; the impact of students’ cluster membership on the supervised assessment components of the course, however, is nonsignificant.

AB  - [This paper is part of the Focused Collection in Artificial Intelligence Tools in Physics Teaching and Physics Education Research.] Using a high-stakes thermodynamics exam as the sample (252 students, four multipart problems), we investigate the viability of four workflows for AI-assisted grading of handwritten student solutions. We find that the greatest challenge lies in converting handwritten answers into a machine-readable format. The granularity of grading criteria also influences grading performance: employing a fine-grained rubric for entire problems often leads to errors and grading failures, as the model appears to be unable to keep track of scores for more than a handful of rubric items, while grading problems in parts is more reliable but tends to miss nuances. We also found that grading hand-drawn graphics, such as process diagrams, is less reliable than mathematical derivations due to the difficulty in differentiating essential details from extraneous information. Although the system is precise in identifying exams that meet passing criteria, exams with failing grades still require human grading. We conclude with recommendations to overcome some of the encountered challenges.

AB  - Machine learning algorithms have recently been used to classify students as those likely to receive an A or B or students likely to receive a C, D, or F in a physics class. The performance metrics used in that study become unreliable when the outcome variable is substantially unbalanced. This study seeks to further explored the classification of students who will receive a C, D, and F and extend those methods to predicting whether a student will receive a D or F. The sample used for this work ($N=7184$) is substantially unbalanced with only 12\% of the students receiving a D or F. Applying the same methods as the previous study produced a classifier that was very inaccurate, classifying only 20\% of the D or F cases correctly. This study will focus on the random forest machine learning algorithm. By adjusting the random forest decision threshold, the correct classification rate of the D or F outcome rose to 46\%. This study also investigated the previous finding that demographic variables such as gender, underrepresented minority status, and first generation status had low variable importance for predicting class outcomes. Downsampling revealed that this was not the result of the underrepresentation of these students. An optimized classification model was constructed which predicted the D and F outcome with 46\% accuracy and C, D, and F outcome with 69\% accuracy; the accuracy of prediction of these outcomes is called "sensitivity" in the machine learning literature. Substantial variation was detected when this classification model was applied to predict the C, D, or F outcome for underrepresented demographic groups with 61\% sensitivity for women, 67\% for underrepresented minority students, and 78\% for first-generation students. Similar variation was observed for the D and F outcome.

 Large language models (LLMs), which are a specific subset of artificial intelligence (AI), may have the potential to revolutionize education by addressing common student misconceptions in physics. This study investigates the effectiveness of popular LLMs, such as OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot, in identifying and addressing misconceptions related to Newtonian mechanics in high school physics. The focus solely is on the misconception that for an elevator to move upward, the force exerted by the cable must be greater than the gravitational force acting downward on the elevator, which contradicts Newton’s first law of motion. To explore this, thirty-two experienced instructors engaged in dialogues with the LLMs, simulating learners with this misconception. Instructors evaluated the LLMs’ accuracy, personalization, and pedagogical effectiveness. The findings indicate that most instructors recognized the substantial potential of LLMs to improve student learning, particularly in addressing misconceptions through interactive dialogue, targeted questioning, and clear explanations tailored to each learner’s needs. ChatGPT ranked highest, demonstrating capabilities in delivering clear explanations, adapting to individual learners, and implementing effective teaching strategies. Google Gemini followed closely, while Microsoft Copilot was the least effective. This capability holds promise for enhancing conceptual understanding and student engagement in physics education. However, limitations were noted in the LLMs’ ability to facilitate personalized scientific discussions and utilize visual aids, such as physics diagrams, simulations, to enhance understanding. This research demonstrates the significant potential of LLMs as valuable tools for identifying and addressing misconceptions in physics education.

AB  - As the development and application of large language models (LLMs) in physics education progress, the well-known AI-based chatbot ChatGPT4 has presented numerous opportunities for educational assessment. Investigating the potential of AI tools in practical educational assessment carries profound significance. This study explored the comparative performance of ChatGPT4 and human graders in scoring upper-secondary physics essay questions. Eighty upper-secondary students’ responses to two essay questions were evaluated by 30 pre-service teachers and ChatGPT4. The analysis highlighted their scoring consistency and accuracy, including intra-human comparisons, GPT grading at different times, human-GPT comparisons, and grading variations across cognitive categories. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess consistency, while accuracy was illustrated through Pearson correlation coefficient analysis with expert scores. The findings reveal that while ChatGPT4 demonstrated higher consistency in scoring, human scorers showed superior accuracy in most instances. These results underscore the strengths and limitations of using LLMs in educational assessments. The high consistency of LLMs can be valuable in standardizing assessments across diverse educational contexts, while the nuanced understanding and flexibility of human graders are irreplaceable in handling complex subjective evaluations.

In particular, the effects it has on education and learning has received a lot of attention. This paper focuses on if indeed AI can be used as a useful tool in tackling engineering problems. Here, based on my limited experience with AI but a long history of teaching engineering courses I have come to some conclusions about if AI can become helpful for learning engineering subjects, in which the physics of matters play an important role. Although this work is limited more to engineering problems, it can well apply to other disciplines, such as biology, economics, and some other subjects.The main question is if AI can provide us with ways for better teaching or facilitates the ways students learn a subject. In this regard, first it must be reliable and trustworthy. It is shown that the present performance of AI is not acceptable/satisfactory to provide correct and reliable help for education of engineering subjects.

AB  - While the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in education is widely recognized, the rapid evolution of these technologies necessitates a corresponding evolution in teacher education. This research sought to investigate the impact of a targeted training program on pre-service physics teachers’ AI literacy levels and their subsequent attitudes and intentions toward AI adoption in their future teaching.A pre-post-test control group quasi-experimental study was implemented among physics teacher education students. A 5 weeks long out-of-curriculum intervention was designed and implemented that combined theoretical grounding with practical, problem-based learning activities, with a focus on the use of various AI tools.There was a significant upswing in AI literacy performance post-intervention, showcasing that the training was effective in facilitating participants’ understanding and application of AI in educational contexts. Additionally, perceived usefulness of AI was found to be a partial mediator in the link between literacy scores and behavioral intention to embed generative solutions into potential teaching.The study concludes that incorporating comprehensive AI literacy programs into teacher education curricula is essential for fostering a technologically adept and pedagogically innovatively minded teaching workforce. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of AI literacy training on teacher practice and student learning outcomes.

AB  - This article presents a comprehensive analysis of data-driven learning technologies—specifically Learning Analytics (LA) dashboards and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tutoring systems—in undergraduate physics education. Emphasizing the importance of pedagogical integration and sociological context, the study explores how these tools influence learning outcomes, student engagement, and equity. 
Learning Analytics dashboards are shown to support engagement and self-regulation, particularly when integrated with active learning pedagogies. However, their direct impact on academic achievement remains inconsistent, with effectiveness hinging on design and implementation. AI tutoring systems, including cognitive, dialogue-based, and generative models (such as RAG-based LLMs), display greater promise in enhancing conceptual understanding, problem-solving skills, and personalization. Their success depends not only on technological capability but also on the alignment with learner needs, faculty acceptance, and social equity. 
The study employs a triangulated methodology combining international case studies, sociological theory (TAM, ANT, Bourdieu), and synthesized survey data to assess user perceptions. It identifies key barriers, such as technological fluency gaps, digital divides, and ethical concerns around data privacy, algorithmic bias, and over-reliance on automation. A focused lens on Armenia’s context underscores infrastructural and pedagogical challenges limiting adoption. 
The article concludes with a critical synthesis: data-driven tools can significantly enhance physics education but are not panaceas. Their success depends on context-sensitive pedagogical integration, faculty and student readiness, and ethical design. Recommendations emphasize hybrid human-AI models, explainable AI, and equity-first deployment strategies.

However, limited research has investigated AI-driven Design Thinking approaches in this domain. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of AI-powered learning tools in improving student performance in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology among pre-medical students. A quasi-experimental study was conducted with 50 pre-medical students (ages 17–21) using a pre-test and post-test design over four weeks. Participants engaged with AI-based learning platforms (ChatGPT, OpenAI Playground, Napkin AI, and DeepSeek AI) for structured problem-solving, real-time feedback, and interactive knowledge reinforcement. Learning outcomes were assessed using paired t-tests, correlation analysis, and linear regression modeling. The findings indicate a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.001) in post-test scores across all subjects. Chemistry (R² = 0.862) and Mathematics (R² = 0.822) exhibited the highest learning gains, while Physics (R² = 0.713) and Biology (R² = 0.766) showed moderate improvements. Correlation analysis revealed a strong relationship between Mathematics and Physics (0.82), suggesting AI-assisted numerical reasoning enhanced interdisciplinary problem-solving skills. Meanwhile, Biology had the lowest correlation with Mathematics (0.74), indicating AI models need multimodal integration (e.g., virtual labs) for conceptual subjects. These results highlight AI’s potential to revolutionize pre-medical education by personalizing learning experiences, strengthening interdisciplinary connections, and improving problem-solving skills. Future AI-driven educational models should incorporate longitudinal studies, adaptive learning algorithms, and multimodal AI applications to optimize their effectiveness in conceptual and applied sciences.

AB  - Generative Artiﬁcial Intelligence (gen-AI) is rapidly becoming more integrated into today’s classrooms in all ranges of education. In higher education, Gen-AI is often seen as a resource for students, aiding them in drafting outlines, solving simple mathematical problems, or even decoding or constructing code. In this paper, we analyze essay-based interviews (N=6) from an upper-division computational physics course, in which physics majors addressed their views and attitudes towards Gen-AI and how it affects their learning. We analyzed the concepts of creativity and gen-AI using the Four C Model, a framework encompassing four types of creativity. Our analysis of the data involved coding and characterizing students’ deﬁnitions of creativity and generative AI. Our ﬁndings revealed two main observations: ﬁrst, students conceptualized their creativity primarily within mini-c and little-c; second, students perceived gen-AI as a resource and learning tool but expressed skepticism regarding its accuracy and creativity.

 Quantum cryptography is a central topic in the quantum technology field that is particularly important for secure communication. The training of qualified experts in this field is necessary for continuous development. However, the abstract and complex nature of quantum physics makes the topic difficult to understand. Augmented reality (AR) allows otherwise invisible abstract concepts to be visualized and enables interactive learning, offering significant potential for improving quantum physics education in university lab courses. In addition, personalized feedback on challenging concepts can facilitate learning, and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can effectively deliver such feedback. This study combines these two aspects and explores the impact of an AR-based quantum cryptography experiment with integrated ChatGPT-based feedback on university students’ learning outcomes and cognitive processes. The study involved 21 groups (11 Group A; 10 Group B) of students in a physics laboratory course at a German university and used four open-ended questions to measure learning outcomes and gaze data as a learning process assessment. Statistical analysis was used to compare scores between feedback and non-feedback questions, and the effect of ChatGPT feedback on eye-tracking data was examined. The results show that ChatGPT feedback significantly improved learning outcomes and affected gaze data. While the feedback on conceptual questions tended to direct attention to the visualizations of the underlying model, the feedback on questions about experimental procedures increased visual attention to the real experimental materials. Overall, the results show that AI-based feedback draws visual attention towards task-relevant factors and increases learning performance in general.

AB  - Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the use of digital learning or education platforms has significantly increased. Teachers now digitally distribute homework and provide exercise questions. In both cases, teachers need to continuously develop novel and individual questions. This process can be very time-consuming and should be facilitated and accelerated both through exchange with other teachers and by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. To address this need, we propose a multilingual Wikimedia framework that allows for collaborative worldwide teacher knowledge engineering and subsequent AI-aided question generation, test, and correction. As a proof of concept, we present >>PhysWikiQuiz<<, a physics question generation and test engine. Our system (hosted by Wikimedia at https://physwikiquiz.wmflabs.org) retrieves physics knowledge from the open community-curated database Wikidata. It can generate questions in different variations and verify answer values and units using a Computer Algebra System (CAS). We evaluate the performance on a public benchmark dataset at each stage of the system workflow. For an average formula with three variables, the system can generate and correct up to 300 questions for individual students based on a single formula concept name as input by the teacher.

AB  - This study explores the use of artificial intelligence in grading high-stakes physics exams, emphasizing the application of psychometric methods, particularly item response theory, to evaluate the reliability of AI-assisted grading. We examine how grading rubrics can be iteratively refined and how threshold parameters can determine when AI-generated grades are reliable versus when human intervention is necessary. By adjusting thresholds for correctness measures and uncertainty, AI can grade with high precision, significantly reducing grading workloads while maintaining accuracy. Our findings show that AI can achieve a coefficient of determination of R2≈0.91 when handling half of the grading load, and R2≈0.96 for one-fifth of the load. These results demonstrate AI’s potential to assist in grading large-scale assessments, reducing both human effort and associated costs. However, the study underscores the importance of human oversight in cases of uncertainty or complex problem solving, ensuring the integrity of the grading process.

AB  - Large language modules (LLMs) have great potential for auto-grading student written responses to physics problems due to their capacity to process and generate natural language. In this explorative study, we use a prompt engineering technique, which we name"scaffolded chain of thought (COT)", to instruct GPT-3.5 to grade student written responses to a physics conceptual question. Compared to common COT prompting, scaffolded COT prompts GPT-3.5 to explicitly compare student responses to a detailed, well-explained rubric before generating the grading outcome. We show that when compared to human raters, the grading accuracy of GPT-3.5 using scaffolded COT is 20% - 30% higher than conventional COT. The level of agreement between AI and human raters can reach 70% - 80%, comparable to the level between two human raters. This shows promise that an LLM-based AI grader can achieve human-level grading accuracy on a physics conceptual problem using prompt engineering techniques alone.

AB  - The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education offers both opportunities and challenges, particularly in fields like physics that demand precise conceptual understanding. This study examines the capabilities of six state-of-the-art LLMs in explaining the law of conservation of momentum, a fundamental principle in physics. By analyzing responses to a consistent, simple prompt in Japanese, we assess the models' explanatory approaches, depth of understanding, and adaptability to different educational levels.Our comprehensive analysis, encompassing text characteristics, response similarity, and keyword usage, unveils significant diversity in explanatory styles across models. ChatGPT4.0 and Coral provided more comprehensive and technically detailed explanations, while Gemini models tended toward more intuitive approaches. Key findings include variations in the treatment of critical concepts such as net force, and differing emphases on mathematical rigor and real-world applications.The results indicate that different AI models may be more suitable for various educational contexts, ranging from introductory to advanced levels. ChatGPT4.0 and Coral demonstrated potential for advanced discussions, while Gemini models appeared more appropriate for introductory explanations. Importantly, the study underscores the necessity of educator guidance in effectively leveraging these AI tools, as models varied in their ability to convey nuanced aspects of physical principles.This research establishes a foundation for understanding the educational potential of LLMs in physics, providing insights for educators on integrating these tools into their teaching practices. It also highlights the need for further investigation into AI-assisted learning in STEM fields, paving the way for more sophisticated applications of AI in physics education.

We examine the efficacy of our system via a randomized A/B/C test, assessing learning gains and motivation shifts among the learners. Our study demonstrates the potential of applying large language models to educational practice on STEM subjects. The results will shed light on the design of educational system in terms of harnessing AI's potential to empower educational stakeholders.

AB  - Problem solving is an integral part of any physics curriculum, and most physics instructors would likely agree that the associated learner competencies are best assessed by considering the solution path: not only the final solution matters, but also how the learner arrived there. Unfortunately, providing meaningful feedback on written derivations is much more labor and resource intensive than only grading the outcome: currently, the latter can be done by computer, while the former involves handwritten solutions that need to be graded by humans. This exploratory study proposes an AI-assisted workflow for grading written physics-problem solutions, and it evaluates the viability of the actual grading step using GPT-4. It is found that the AI-tool is capable of providing feedback that can be helpful in formative assessment scenarios, but that for summative scenarios, particularly those that are high-stakes, it should only be used for an initial round of grading that sorts and flags solution approaches.

AB  - Modern education faces a number of challenges related to the rapid development of technologies and the changing needs of society. An important task for educators is not only to transmit knowledge but also to foster a sustainable motivation for students to learn, especially in the field of natural sciences such as physics. Despite the immense potential of this subject in developing logical thinking and problem-solving skills, physics often poses difficulties for students and leads to a decline in interest in studying it. One of the reasons for this is the complexity of perceiving abstract concepts and the lack of connection to everyday life. Therefore, the search for new, more effective teaching methods that can help overcome these barriers and ignite interest in the subject is relevant. Digital educational content (DEC) and artificial intelligence (AI) represent one of the promising solutions capable of changing the approach to education and increasing students' motivation. The article substantiates and proves the prospects for using AI as a means of motivating students in learning physics. One of the main advantages of AI is the ability to create personalized learning programs that take into account the level of knowledge, the pace of material assimilation, and the interests of the student. This is especially relevant for studying physics, as complex and abstract concepts can be presented in an accessible and interactive form using virtual laboratories, simulators, and games. Such technologies not only make learning more engaging but also allow students to better assimilate the material, which in turn contributes to the growth of their motivation. In addition, modern AI technologies allow for the introduction of gamification elements into the educational process. The use of game mechanics such as achievements, levels, and rewards stimulates students to engage more actively in learning and creates additional external and internal motivation.

The teacher's role in making science/physics learning activities effective, interactive and communicative is very large. For this reason, teachers need to increase their insight and upgrade their knowledge of Artificial Intelligence-based digital technology so that learning objectives can be achieved effectively. Of course, the application of Artificial Intelligence in accordance with the material taught in science/physics lessons will make learning activities more interesting and have a positive impact on the progress of education in Indonesia. Even though the positive impact of Artificial Intelligence is more dominant than the negative impact, it is necessary to anticipate the negative impact of using AI in science/physics learning so that progress in the education sector becomes more efficient, effective and safe in the future.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs, which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency, facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific discovery.

AB  - [This paper is part of the Focused Collection in Artificial Intelligence Tools in Physics Teaching and Physics Education Research.] Recent research in science education has largely focused on using ChatGPT to solve problems and evaluating its accuracy and problem-solving features. However, as artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming an important tool for human development, effective strategies for learning and education using human-AI collaboration (HAI) learning remain underexplored. HAI is emerging as a powerful tool for enhancing educational outcomes, especially with the integration of advanced natural language AI systems such as ChatGPT-4o. This study explores the role of HAI in solving scientific problems, comparing its efficacy with human-human collaboration (HHC) among high school students. We employed two different groups: one using HAI with ChatGPT-4o, and the other using HHC, focusing on their performance in scientific knowledge and scientific thinking tasks. Results showed that while both collaboration methods significantly improved students’ performance in solving scientific problems, HHC exhibited a greater effect size compared to HAI. The use of ChatGPT-4o was particularly noted for its ability to provide interactive learning experiences and guide students through problem solving; however, challenges such as inconsistencies in responses and image recognition hindered its effectiveness. Additionally, students tended to use ChatGPT-4o as a tool for obtaining answers rather than engaging in deeper collaborative explorations. This study underscores the importance of developing targeted training for students in effectively collaborating with AI tools. The results can also provide useful information for future exploration on methods to strengthen HHC by integrating AI tools, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to enhance education outcomes.

AB  - Misconceptions in physics education, particularly in work and energy, present significant barriers to student understanding and achievement. Common misconceptions include misunderstandings of energy conservation principles, misapplying work-energy relationships, and confusion between potential and kinetic energy. These misconceptions are critical as they form the foundation for understanding more complex physics concepts. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Intelligent Teacher Assistant System (ITAS), which integrates the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework with machine learning to diagnose and address misconceptions in real-time. ITAS’s unique innovations include adaptive feedback tailored to individual learning needs, real-time diagnostics, and seamless alignment of technological tools with pedagogical strategies. System validation achieved a reliability score of 93.02% and usability score of 94.44%, based on standardized expert evaluations. Field testing with 150 students and 30 teachers demonstrated a 75% improvement in conceptual understanding, with average post-test scores increasing by 20%. These results underscore ITAS’s potential to transform physics education by addressing persistent misconceptions and fostering deeper student engagement. Future research will explore extending ITAS’s application to other subjects and refining its adaptive algorithms.
